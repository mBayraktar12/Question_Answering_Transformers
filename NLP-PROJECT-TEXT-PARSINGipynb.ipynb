Zero actually meanings nothing, it is abstract maths. But with zero you can do many calculations for engineering easily. On the other and we used abstraction to solve some physical problems. We abstract the physical problem and solve them with using some mathematical methods. It is quite important for engineering.

Abstract maths helps us to understand enginnering better. For example 0 and 1(binary digits) makes easy to understand computer. And people develope new computer language using abstraction. And we can understand computer more easy.\\n23\\tThings in real world can be represented by abstraction. I mean color of shoe has no meaning for computer unless we teach it via usage of abstraction technique. For example, invention of zero is also type of abstraction (that is comes from Indıan religion \"Nirvana\"). Anything you see in the real world can be represented on computer via using Abstraction. We can represent their functions and ability. Being representetif of something allows us to get everything from real world via abstraction. For example let\\'s assume you have a car. İn computer science you can represent it with usage of classes, also you can create example of that class. Class can have field and fuctions of it represent thing.\\n24\\tits help to imagine.\\n25\\tAbstraction is helping us for be good engineer.Thanks to abstraction we can use thinking more analytical.And again thanks to abstraction we can use zero in our current counting system.Because abstraction is helping us to think about nothingness and existence.\\n26\\t\"How does abstraction helps us do engineering better\\nIt makes simple do that It help us the solutions for questions\\nabstraction is a thinking freely \"\\n27\\twith using abstraction we can shorten the average time we\\'re going to spend on a work. its simply more efficient\\n28\\t\"\\nHow does abstraction helps us do engineering better?\\n\\nRoma\\'s civilization engineering for military.\\nGreeks used to math,observe and explain for science.\\nCause and effect(Aristotle)\\nUse the math prove\\nObserve nature and explain.\\nScience can find all.\\nAristotles deductives(Tümdengelim).\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\n29\\t\"How does abstraction helps us do engineering better.\\nimprove  establish invented observation approximation approximate  politic economy infrastructure law people conflict of interest play rule predict abstract conclusion astronomy Galileo newton humanity democrat destruction  public administration concrete Julian calendar Gregorian calendar punishment surgery math tragedy theater formal logical discuss war perform science monarchy powers of kings nature philosophy approach  physics arbitrarily classification audience rights of law establish invented try What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth ?

An engineer is always going to face many of problems and wants to solve them . Because it is his job . To make easy the solutions , abstraction is very helpful selection . For instance an civil engineer might face to a problem when construct an build . If he/she use abstraction - he think the problem in his/her mind as abstract - the problem will be easier to solve .\\n31\\tFor example in real world the thinks aren\\'t perfectly shaped. But in geometry we can assume that there are perfect shapes and can do calculations on them.\\n32\\tAbstraction is important because people use that to improve science.İf people improved the science engineering would be better.\\n33\\tAbstraction helps us do engineering better ,zero, limit, infinity.

All of them could be exist with thinking abstract.\\n41\\t\"Zero is the most abstraction. Zero had been invented for esaier calculations and abstract mathematic.\\nfor example, when ı use computer most users unaware the inner workings in the computer. \\nI can learn this because of abstraction. \"\\n42\\t\\n43\\tAbstraction helps to avoid time wasting and prevents problems before they happens because we imagine before we take action and see those problems so we prevent those problems.\\n44\\tAbstraction is a thinking way. It help us to find solutions to specifically or hard physicial problems. You can abstract a problem basically in your mind and you can solve this problem on your mind. After that you can solve this problem on real life because you find a way with thinking and you know what to do.\\n45\\tIn some problems we may not have as many as matter to solve the problem.So abstraction helps us to solve our problem without even having the material.With this way now engineering came so far.\\n46\\t\"\\'Today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrow\\'s applied math.\\'\\nWe can use 0 and calculate the equation by abstraction and then we can use this thing in applied math and engineering like Pyramids.\"\\n47\\t\"Some calculating needs more effort than ordinary human can. So in this reason especially in math people had to assume some steps that they can\\'t do in order to complete the thing that they started. For example, calculating PI.\\nAlso reality has some limit that you can\\'t surpass ,but abstraction can make you feel free when you think about something.  \\n\"\\n48\\tAbstraction helps us solve a real world, physical problem by making it an abstract one, one that is solvable intellectually, without any physical work. \\n49\\tThey could imagine better and cleverly.\\n50\\tThe inventions are constructed in the mind of their inventor and we say abstraction it. Therefore, if we make a lot of abstraction about the invention or machine , we can have the best engineering devices so engineering developing thanks  to abstraction.\\n51\\twe descripe to hard thing and it will be easy for us\\n52\\tWe can say abstraction is symbol of nothingness.Sometimes we can not  explain  everything with mathematical symbols so abstraction help us about this.Abstraction is also generelazition and it is important to engineering.\\n53\\tAbstraction provides us more exact conclusions on our calculations and studies in the branchs of science. It helps us deeply and more effective work while we working on problems .\\n54\\tIt helps us solve our problems in our head without actually doing some difficult experiments. And It also helps us understand some theories that are not suitable for modelizing in real world such as binary system or transistors that says 1 is on and 0 is off which is related to electric currency.\\n55\\twe do not take the data we do not need throw them away  so we can focus on data we need clearly\\n56\\tToday we abstract our ideas and tomorrow we can execute our ideas for real in engineering because if we want the make something happens we need to think what to do. We need to imagine and after that we can do things that we imagined. \\n57\\tfor example we had started thinking better so we did smart works.\\n58\\tWith an Abstraction,it possible to explain experiments or research that couldn\\'t observe the results the in physical life.It makes our job easier.With using this method,  used to understand and predict bring more rational answer to us.progressive and cumulative science improved with that way. \\n59\\tExisting in thought or an idea but not have a physical form.We could calculate the area of house by thinking abstract.For example thinking the area of house as a square.\\n60\\tThere is a saying: \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math.\" As we understand from this quote, abstraction is the step right before the real application. In order to invent new devices, technologies etc. we should take the abstract and apply it by using sciences such as physics and math. Calculus is also related. Isaac Newton did studies on abstract math and couldn\\'t apply all of them into reality, but today, many works of engineering is based on Newton\\'s studies.\\n61\\twith abstraction humanity can built building more easy and stronger\\n62\\tWe found  zero with abstraction  and we can describe it  with use abstraction . Then we solved a lot of problem with use zero.  Also we can find  answer to difficult questions. . We can solve them easly.\\n63\\tAbstraction is very important for us because we need to understand how to solve a problem. Especially maths and physics can do it so if we learn them we can be better engineer better. \\n64\\tIt help us make problem to things that we can solve. For instance, calculating the size of pyramids. We abstract the problem into the our mind so that we can figure it out how we can do.\\n65\\tIt helps us think more creatively, thus we can make complicated problems to simply ones. Then we solve the problems easily or we understend nature.  \\n66\\twe are using this predict and abstract some ideas for prove.for example we want to make new invent or work.firstly we abstract that matter and then we aplly.\\n67\\tAbstraction is an obligation because we know a lot of theorems, rules and calculations but all of them are general. But when we have a real problem, we should transform the base problem into a case (rule, theorem or equation) and we always use abstraction to do this abstraction is transforming the problem unsolvable to solvable. So, if we focus on this basics abstraction can helps us better.\\n68\\tAbstraction turns a problem to mathematically form, and we can use calculus.\\n69\\tWe imagine and generalize problems in our mind then we solve it in our minds.Then we understand the problem and solution,after that we will be able to find a strict solution or proven function.\\n70\\t\"There is a saying \"\"today\\'s abstract mathematic is future\\'s applied mathematic\"\"\\nso every abstract idea can be applied and useful,abstraction is necessary for engineering\"\\n71\\tThings in real world can be respresented by abstraction. The thing what I am trying to say is color of a car  has no meaning for computer unless we teach it with right abstraction technique.\\n72\\tFor example in Abstraction means removal of details. Essentially, you remove unnecessary details to get a clear view. Typically, you want to be able to analyze/demonstrate/prove/communicate/verify/validate a set of properties based on informed design decisions. Seeing the design in the code is like trying to perceive the forest while walking among the trees. You see cues, but not the forest. Different purposes need different abstractions.\\n73\\tAbstraction helps to us about thinking. When we use it, we can do anything as mathematically what we cannot feel in realistic world. So, we can think about infinity and use it. We can also use zero in problem solving or calculating.\\n74\\tIt helps us to do the distinct disicplines better . For instance people used it to laid of foundations mathematics and engineering .Also Before Civilizations of Ancient Greek used abstraction and abstract mathematics to give a meaning of numbers and explain the science a bit rationally.Abstraction is a kind of bridge for the applied maths and engineering and there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math Tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'\\' It  show us The science is cumulative and progressive.\\n75\\t\"We can not doing every thing with applied science but if we use abstraction we can imagine it easily.\\nfor example zero we can not feeling or touching but we can imagine with abstraction and we use in applied engineering. qualitative to quantitative\"\\n76\\twe use math for abstraction nature  so  we always look at the nature for make a new product.. \\n77\\tAbstraction helps us to do engineering better. Objects are real and creating shapes from objects helps engineering to think better. Shaping   , thinking , creating multiple universes , more dimensions \\n78\\t\\n79\\tİf we didnt use abstraction, many things can not understandable for calculations. For example when greeks found PI ,abstraction helped to find this number.It also helped for creating mathematical philosophy like quantum mathematics or etc. . \\n80\\tit helps us think more creatively that we can make problems compeltely in easier way. When we do abstraction the problem can be more clearly and we can find a solution to solve it fast. \\n81\\t\"Todays abstract math is tomorrows applied math. For less effort we used abstraction.\\nWe can guess something: for example distance between Earth and Moon. Approximation helped us. Instant of change and Calculus.\"\\n82\\tAbstraction helps engineer to think more openly and it make us generalize the things that we thought. There are things in World that can be represantive by abstraction. It make easier to think and solve the problems, sought to those problems. If we don\\'t teach the computer what it should know we can\\'t make it work. For example we should teach computer that what color or shine is.\\n83\\tabstraction  helps us in many ways in science. Not only engineering . Also  we use abstraction in math and mathematical expressions. We calculate very big numbers distances. Science is abstract description mathematics using nature\\n84\\t\"Abstraction help us about thinking and solving problems. In the other hand abstraction helps us convert abstraction math to applied math.\\nSo abstraction makes us strong against problems.  \\nIt contributed creating new technologies and fields.\"\\n85\\t\"It helps to imagine problems as models and helps to find logical solutions for real life problems.\\nAnd also it helps to think theoretically and obtain new formulas and relations.\"\\n86\\t Abstraction provide us more exact conclusuions like Abstraction help us to eliminate wrong results and trying to reach perfect result.\\n87\\tObserving nature and finding some problems are fundamental steps of the science. Every day we solve a lot of problems. Engineers also must solve this problems. Abstraction helps us do engineering better because in daily life we observe the nature, find the problem and abstract the things. When we find problem we should think about how can we solve it. That moment we need to abstract it. Predict what kind of problem is and our approach should be correct. Today we abstract some problems , tomorrow problems will be applied. \\n88\\t\\n89\\tWe can\\'t explain our theories or plans without abstraction.For example we all know the fact that if you throw a ball to air it falls.But we can\\'t explain the mathematical truth of this event.To explain it we use abstraction.In engineering it\\'s similar because if you want to invent something first you have to plan and calculate things for those you must use numbers at least and as we know the numbers are abstraction we use it everywhere in engineering.Also the future engineers can look back and inspire from them so they will be able to invent better things.\\n90\\tabstraction helps us about fictioning the function in our mind and it is important to engineering  because today s abstract thinking tomorrow s reality.\\n91\\t\"it make us abstract  issue  of real life in your head by math.\\n\\n\\n\"\\n92\\tAbstraction help us to predict of the problem. Observe the nature and find the with abstraction of the problem. And solution of abstraction we trying to fins rational answer for problem. Also abstraction made of Mathematics.\\n93\\tAbstraction is a method which we can think no existing object or content. Because of this, We can planing building a structer without actually build thanks to abstraction.\\n94\\tAbstraction is an indispensable tool in the engineering process. Engineers can improve their ability to relate physically distinct concepts.Abstracting concrete events.\\n95\\tAbstraction remove the connections to real world and make them generic  so that we can think processes and make operations simply. Important theorems and rules generally based on abstract math. Today\\'s abstract mats is tomorrows applied math. So we are using rules, informations and theorms which discovered by abstraction years ago, and it helps us for better engineering.  \\n96\\t\\n97\\tbecuse we learned how to brtter wtih limtes and this make us think about it \\n98\\t\\n99\\tthey practice agriculture and they calculating abstract things\\n100\\thelps us to think more efficiently and more creatively. and helps us to solve the problems by different ways and testing methods to solve problems \\n101\\tZero is the most important abstraction. Defining something that does not exist, always was one of the biggest question marks in people\\'s mind, even back in Ancient Greece. However now we know that in binary, in computers\\' life language, zero is one of the most important aspect. Things exist and they don\\'t, binary and in it\\'s essence zero let\\'s us define those that do not exist. Whenever we code something that has no value, something that has no name 0 is one of the most used defining methods in engineering. Zero volt energy, means we don\\'t have any electric. If we have zero amount of a material, that building can\\'t use that material. In essence engineering is having one thing and not having the other one. Zero is the name we give to those we do not have.\\n102\\t\"Abstraction helps to us like thinking about the zero\"\"0\"\"Because zero is nothing but we can think about zero.\\nIt is not just that .We should think about Math.Math is meanless if we can not think about it.Like in integer and limit you should think infinity and approaching to infinity.There is a lot examples..\\nToday\\'s abstraction is tommorow\\'s applied Math.\\n\\n\"\\n103\\tIf there is a problem, we can take it into an abstractio form and solve it with using mathematics, formulas. It helps us to think about a solution.\\n104\\tIt is really important because we need to start from thinking. And abstraction help us to see what is our plan and what are we going to do. It give us a logic and ideas. There is a saying which is \"Todays abstract math is tomorrows applied math. \" For example if we are planning to make mobile app first we need to make abstraction which is define what we are going to use for technology. Or it is also same with classes in programming to we are doing abstraction for example we have users so we need to define usernames and surnames and it is the abstraction. It is like blueprinting\\n105\\tAbstraction is turning real life problems into the ones that we can solve on our minds. That includes turning them into a mathematical ones as well. So abstraction helps us do engineering better because we can actually do calculations if we abstract real life problems into the ones that we can solve.\\n106\\tWe can apply maths in something we can face in daily life. We can abstract a problem in to smaller pieces and its easier the solve.and we can apply maths to this problem.\\n107\\tit is modelling the structures and that helps to engineer. engineer  solves problems and thinks better with abstraction.\\n108\\t\"abstraction is making together things to get them understand easily.\\nit\\'s like you have something smaller and you put a few of them together and you get a bigger thing.\\nand you use the bigger thing for your next project instead of using small thing again and again.\\nfor example you have a function in a program you just call it when you need it you\\'re not typing the commands that inside the that function again and again.\\nso in that way engineering , math , physic became more understandable and easy to use.\\nand they put real life problems into math . that is abstraction\"\\n109\\tTodays abstract math tomorrows applied math.In the early parts of project if engineer thinks abstractly next moves can be easy  and engineer can make next stepes more easy . Abstract thinking is predicting.\\n110\\tWe can think things better with abstraction for example on mathematics if we use abstraction we can applie it in programs,robots and etc.\\n111\\tIt helps us to think and be creative.And helps us find solutions to the problems we cant solve by simply testing such as infinite problems \\n112\\tWe can easily understand the problems with abstraction because its help us to imagine the problem in our mind.İt helps us a lot because engineer must solve problems quickly and the best way he/she can.\\n113\\tI wish to start a sentence; Todays abstract math tomorrows practic math. It means that we need to first bring an idea with abstraction wheter or not possible. For example Jules Verne when he first wrote to \"Ay\\'a Yolculuk\" he seen to other people as crazy or abstract but his dream comes true after decades. The point I\\'m trying to make here is that as engineer we mostly cant do things that doesnt thinked and in the process of thinking these things abstraction is crutial  \\n114\\tAbstraction means  solving the real life problems with using our minds. Abstraction help us the generilaze our problems and make a solution from our knowledge. With using abstraction we can make our disicinous more easier.\\n115\\tabstraction makes us generilze and think out of the box. we can makes theories without any information and prove the hypotesis.\\n116\\tAbstraction helps us solve real life problems with mathematics and calculus. We abstract the information on mechanics and apply the information to real life problems. It helps us approximate the solution better. Archimedes used this on approximating pi.\\n117\\tıf you had a problem you should understand that in that helps you to convert it to mathematic mathematical language otherwise you cant abstarct things procrastination by infinitly instant changes cumulative informations helps ıf you had three things square triangle and circle ıf you dont abstract them you cant solve and explain infinity problems \\n118\\t...\\n119\\tWe can abstract mathemathical things from their physical bindings and make them more general so that we can use it for more problems.\\n120\\tSince abstraction is a process of conceptualizing things, it simplifies things and gives us a different perspective to provide a clearer approach.It turns a big problem into a smaller problem.\\n121\\tWhen we have a problem we can abstract it so that it can become simplified which makes us understand the problems better and come up with solutions easier\\n122\\tIf we know the how inside of the job works we can do better at outside of the job too.When we abstrac a machine or a job we can learn about how is it doing that thing inside of the machine.\\n123\\tIt helps us to see the problem\\'s solutions in different ways.It also helps us to create new ideas and solutions.And sometimes when calculating is limited it helps us to think in different parallels.So since engineering is a job that needs creativity and maybe a bit overthinking,an engineer should learn and know how to abstract something in their mind.\\n124\\tOf course it increased the limits of our brains and our imagination. But the real reason why abstraction helped us is not using any tools when we are doing abstraction. You can approximately calculate the rocks in the Konyaaltı just in your mind. In this situation thinking about something that needs math or physics is getting easier to get the results. That takes engineering abilities in our mind to different level. By that we never wait for a calculator to do something about engineering. And also it make us think hard things as a quick easy problems.\\n125\\tIt helps us thinking theoretically . It generalizes the idea/problem.\\n126\\tAbstraction provide easier way to do engineering. We can imagine and then write it by codes so that important work emerge. For instance, let us think a shop. This shop needs a programme because they cannot follow the their stocks. An computer engineer for solving this problem imagine and can improve an application. \\n127\\tto solve a nature problem with math firstly we can understand it and. we can understand it in real but we can apply this to math because in math there are  many answers. so we firstly abtraction a problem and then we can applied to math this problem.\\n128\\tAbstraction helps us engineers with preparing algorithms to our problems. It helps us think about the problem first and how to solve it.\\n129\\tAbstraction is taking the problems in nature and trying to solve them with symbols. Mathematic is a perfect way to abstract a problem. In engineering we have to come up with functions to solve problems. These functions are mathematical problems. Therefore we always abstract our problems to solve them.\\n130\\tby making people think efficiently. for example there is a saying \"todays abstraction math is tomorrows applied math\" which means the mathematical terms we are thinking about but cant really comprehend today for example some kind of paradoxes or some theorems that are not proven yet will possibly be taught at high schools in the future. So its a cumulative thing. The abstraction we do today is going to help the engineers in the future.\\n131\\tEngineers need to prove their it is helping us while we are proving something.\\n132\\tIt helps us to find solutions to specifically physical problems. Abstracting is making problems easier to solve while using logic, physics, instantaneous values and mathematics and especially calculus. We can use abstraction, then differentiation and integral so that measurement and engineering is easier. \\n133\\tAbstraction in mathematics helped in a good way to engineering better. Also the way we think and the way see today is more beyond the space and time. It helped us to make sense things we cant actually see in reality.\\n134\\tAbstraction helps us to understand better axioms. Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. We understand better with formulas. We need to start thinking and to do that we need to understand what we are supposed to think. \\n135\\tWhen trying to solve a problem through engineering one can\\'t always have a solid, physical sight to think or calculate something beforehand, Maths is the language of engineering and physics and helps us to think and visualize in an abstract way that could prevent giant mistakes and accidents. \\n136\\t\"Todays abstract math is tomorrows engineering math.\\nAbstraction helps us to use unkown things.\"\\n137\\tThat makes easier to predict the next step and think about a problem and its solution.\\n138\\tWe can abstract some physical things to Mathematical or other Scientific models with abstraction. So, it can help us to understand and make better industrial or daily things. We can do  engineering better thanks to abstraction.\\n139\\tHelps engineers foresee the problems and makes it possible to take precautions in order to solve the problem before it happens.\\n140\\tWhen we abstract something before we work on it, it is more easy to get over this problem and cheaper and time-saver because we first use imagination so the problem can be more solvable and our approach to problem become more fast.\\n141\\tThey can think correctly of calculations .  Abstraction provided the abstract math become the applied math which we use todayin modern system. Also there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\' applied math.\\'\\' Also algebra is big effect in the engineering .

Engineers can use this for calculating abstract things. This helps for engineers to solving abstract problems. abstraction is useful for think easily. 2: \"İnvested Zero and then invested number. First of all binary system. then we calculate some science and math problems with this invested \". 3: there is a famous line: today's abstract math is tomorrow' s applied, Which means that we developed math and better way to express things with abstract math. 4: Abstraction is one of the greatest tool of the engineer. By abstracting a problem we can solve little pieces of a bigger problem and connect all of the at the end. 5: \"Before, abstract Math is today's proven science\". Some ideas can be abstract now. however, it might be proven by other scientists in the future. So it is important to get a development. 6: with abstraction we can understand things that difficualt to understandd. approximation law by infinity, instant change, abstract predict interest, approximation, senate tragedy, deomocracy. 7- 8: \"Zero is representive abstraction. Thus calculating and engineering are better \". 9: \"Nothingness or having nothing. It gives rise. the ability for a common person to be able to do mathematics isn’t. Before it, mathematicians struggled to perform the simplest arithmetic calculations. zero helps generalize nothingness\". 10: it helps us to make calculations calculating more easily. it helps us to generalize things. for instance, before the invention of 0, they just use nothing. invention of zero helps generalizing and representing nothingness. we observe nature and convert it to theoric information. 11: \"Today's abstract math is tomorrow's applied math. Everything is more easier with abstract math. \". 12: with abstraction you can understand examples and problem time in engineering process. thorugh abstraction when you solved problem so you will be able translate problem which solved from one branch of engineering into anothers. so you will gain time and money because you won't spend money and time to solve them again. 13: \"Abstraction is important because algorithm Engineers can see something but they don't understand something. what can they understand? send to some object they can easily use to understand and predict\". 14- 15, \"because abstraction helps us to think that we will do before doing it. it shows us what we do actually but not completed. it decreases the cost of product\". 16: \"How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? Old people knows to: \"\"How can we add something from past\"\" and they are really good searcher. because of that. their engineering was good: Egypt, Greeks, Rome\". 17: to solve any problem in life, first you gotta abstract it to the formal math language. and also abstraction helps us to put things in groups, naturel numbersfull numbers. those all are kind a abstraction. even one of the most significiant invention of math, the zero, is the most important abstracton example in math. it helped us to create 10 based system. with that way we could define really big quantities and got many, much benefits. 18: abstraction help us when we need calculate maths, physics problem without absraction. we cannot do this thing. for example, if we calculate diameter, a radius or something liike that we need abstactionand this tihng help us engineerto creatvive things, for example coding and thinking about coding, deep thinking, alll of this thing s abstarction. 19, 20, For example, zero. Zero actually meanings nothing. it is abstract maths But with zero you can do many calculations for engineering easily. On the other, and we used abstraction to solve some physical problems, We abstract the physical problem and solve them with using some mathematical methods. It is quite important for engineering. We can solve some problems better with abstraction. it is really important for the engineering. 21: \"solving problems easily with abstraction. Engineering handle the problems if problems selected one by one. What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Goverment? What is the role of the theater in the Ancient Greece and Rome. How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth\". 22: Abstraction is generalising complex things. Abstract maths helps us to understand enginnering better. For example, 0 and 1(binary digits) makes easy to understand computer And people develope new computer language using abstraction And we can understand computer more easy. 23: Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. I mean color of shoe has no meaning for computer unless we teach it via usage of abstraction technique. For example, invention of zero is also type of abstraction (that is comes from Indıan religion \"Nirvana\"). Anything you see in the real world can be represented on computer. via using Abstraction We can represent their functions and ability. Being representetif of something allows us to get everything from real world via abstraction. For example, let's assume you have a car İn computer science you can represent it with usage of classes. also you can create example of that class. Class can have field and fuctions of it represent thing. 24: its help to imagine. 25: Abstraction is helping us for be good engineerThanks to abstraction we can use thinking more analyticalAnd again thanks to abstraction we can use zero in our current counting systemBecause abstraction is helping us to think about nothingness and existence. 26. \"How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? It makes simple, do that It help us the solutions for questions. abstraction is a thinking freely \". 27. with using abstraction we can shorten the average time we're going to spend on a work. its simply more efficient. 28. \" How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? Roma's civilization engineering for military. Greeks used to mathobserve and explain for science Cause and effect(Aristotle). Use the math, prove, Observe nature and explain Science can find all Aristotles deductives(Tümdengelim) \". 29. \"How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? improve, establish, invented observation, approximation, approximate politic, economy, infrastructure, law, people, conflict of interest, play, rule, predict abstract conclusion. astronomy, Galileo, newton, humanity, democrat destruction, public administration, concrete Julian calendar, Gregorian calendar, punishment, surgery, math, tragedy, theater, formal, logical, discuss war, perform science, monarchy, powers of kings, nature, philosophy, approach physics, arbitrarily classification, audience, rights of law. establish invented, try. What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth? What is the role of the theater in the Ancient Greece and Rome? What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Government view\". 30. If there is a problem and we have to solve it, we should abstract it in our mind. So this helps us to solve this problem easily. An engineer is always going to face many of problems and wants to solve them Because it is his job To make easy the solutions. abstraction is very helpful selection, For instance, an civil engineer might face to a problem when construct an build. If he/she use abstraction - he think the problem in his/her mind as abstract - the problem will be easier to solve. 31. For example, in real world the thinks aren't perfectly shaped, But in geometry we can assume that there are perfect shapes and can do calculations on them. 32: Abstraction is important because people use that to improve scienceİf. people improved the science, engineering would be better. 33: Abstraction helps us do engineering better. zero limit, infinity. We know something there, but we do not know how much. Approximation, science, inconsistency, arbitraryInconsistency between themInduction of ideasRome, Ancient GreeceFunction 34: \"abstraction helps us think better of problem and find best solution way engineering better. \". 35. It provides us thinking more efficient and then we do engineering better. 36: Abstraction helps us do engineering betterBecause abstraction is important at the theaterExample: Romans theater and Greeks theater is differentGreek's theater platform is circleAll of them helps us do engineering better. 37. \"the formal lanaguge to computers is binaray, which is passing on zeros and ones, and zero is an abstraction \". 38, 39, \"We can calculate easier with abstractionToday some things easier to understand. with abstraction. We can easily imagine the some thingsAbstraction make easier the engineering. \". 40. in early ages there were very little amounts of knowledge and engineering systems, so abstraction helped them with creativity, solving problems, creating something. All of them could be exist with thinking abstract. 41. \"Zero is the most abstraction. Zero had been invented for esaier calculations and abstract mathematic. for example. when ı use computer, most users unaware the inner workings in the computer. I can learn this because of abstraction \". 42, 43, Abstraction helps to avoid time wasting and prevents problems before they happens, because we imagine before we take action and see those problems, so we prevent those problems. 44: Abstraction is a thinking way. It help us to find solutions to specifically or hard physicial problems. You can abstract a problem basically in your mind and you can solve this problem on your mind. After that you can solve this problem on real life because you find a way with thinking and you know what to do. 45: In some problems we may not have as many as matter to solve the problemSo abstraction helps us to solve our problem without even having the materialWith this way, now, engineering came so far. 46. \"'Today's abstraction math is tomorrow's applied math'. We can use 0 and calculate the equation by abstraction, and then we can use this thing in applied math and engineering like Pyramids\". 47. \"Some calculating needs more effort than ordinary human can. So in this reason, especially in math, people had to assume some steps that they can't do in order to complete the thing that they started, For example calculating PI. Also, reality has some limit that you can't surpass, but abstraction can make you feel free when you think about something. \". 48. Abstraction helps us solve a real world, physical problem by making it an abstract one, one that is solvable intellectually without any physical work. 49. They could imagine better and cleverly. 50. The inventions are constructed in the mind of their inventor and we say abstraction it. Therefore, if we make a lot of abstraction about the invention or machine, we can have the best engineering devices. so engineering developing thanks to abstraction. 51. we descripe to hard thing and it will be easy for us. 52. We can say: abstraction is symbol of nothingnessSometimes we can not explain everything with mathematical symbols, so abstraction help us about thisAbstraction is also generelazition and it is important to engineering. 53. Abstraction provides us more exact conclusions on our calculations and studies in the branchs of science. It helps us deeply and more effective work while we working on problems. 54. It helps us solve our problems in our head without actually doing some difficult experiments, And It also helps us understand some theories that are not suitable for modelizing in real world, such as binary system or transistors that says 1 is on and 0 is off, which is related to electric currency. 55. we do not take the data we do not need throw them away, so we can focus on data we need clearly. 56. Today we abstract our ideas and tomorrow we can execute our ideas for real in engineering, because if we want the make something happens, we need to think what to do, We need to imagine and after that we can do things that we imagined. 57. for example, we had started thinking better, so we did smart works. 58. With an Abstractionit possible to explain experiments or research that couldn't observe the results. the in physical lifeIt makes our job easierWith using this method used to understand and predict. bring more rational answer to usprogressive and cumulative science improved with that way. 59: Existing in thought or an idea but not have a physical formWe could calculate the area of house by thinking abstractFor example thinking the area of house as a square. 60. There is a saying: \"Today's abstract math is tomorrow's applied math\". As we understand from this quote, abstraction is the step right before the real application. In order to invent new devices, technologies, etc. we should take the abstract and apply it by using sciences such as physics and math. Calculus is also related. Isaac Newton did studies on abstract math and couldn't apply all of them into reality, but today many works of engineering is based on Newton's studies. 61. with abstraction, humanity can built building more easy and stronger. 62. We found zero with abstraction and we can describe it with use abstraction. Then we solved a lot of problem with use zero. Also, we can find answer to difficult questions. We can solve them easly. 63. Abstraction is very important for us because we need to understand how to solve a problem. Especially maths and physics can do it. so if we learn them we can be better, engineer better. 64. It help us make problem to things that we can solve, For instance calculating the size of pyramids. We abstract the problem into the our mind so that we can figure it out how we can do. 65: It helps us think more creatively. thus we can make complicated problems to simply ones. Then we solve the problems easily or we understend nature. 66: we are using this predict and abstract some ideas for provefor example we want to make new, invent or workfirstly we abstract that matter and then we aplly. 67: Abstraction is an obligation because we know a lot of theorems, rules and calculations, but all of them are general. But when we have a real problem we should transform the base problem into a case (rule, theorem or equation) and we always use abstraction to do this. abstraction is transforming the problem unsolvable to solvable. So if we focus on this basics, abstraction can helps us better. 68: Abstraction turns a problem to mathematically form and we can use calculus. 69: We imagine and generalize problems in our mind. then we solve it in our mindsThen we understand the problem and solutionafter that we will be able to find a strict solution or proven function. 70: \"There is a saying: \"\"today's abstract mathematic is future's applied mathematic\"\", so every abstract idea can be applied and usefulabstraction is necessary for engineering\". 71: Things in real world can be respresented by abstraction. The thing what I am trying to say is color of a car has no meaning for computer unless we teach it with right abstraction technique. 72, For example, in Abstraction means removal of details. Essentially you remove unnecessary details to get a clear view. Typically you want to be able to analyze/demonstrate/prove/communicate/verify/validate a set of properties based on informed design decisions. Seeing the design in the code is like trying to perceive the forest while walking among the trees. You see cues but not the forest. Different purposes need different abstractions. 73: Abstraction helps to us about thinking. When we use it we can do anything as mathematically what we cannot feel in realistic world. So we can think about infinity and use it. We can also use zero in problem solving or calculating. 74: It helps us to do the distinct disicplines better. For instance, people used it to laid of foundations, mathematics and engineering. Also Before, Civilizations of Ancient Greek used abstraction and abstract mathematics to give a meaning of numbers and explain the science a bit rationallyAbstraction is a kind of bridge for the applied maths and engineering and there is a saying: ''Today's abstract math, Tomorrow's applied math''. It show us The science is cumulative and progressive. 75: \"We can not doing every thing with applied science, but if we use abstraction we can imagine it easily. for example, zero: we can not feeling or touching, but we can imagine with abstraction and we use in applied engineering qualitative to quantitative\". 76. we use math for abstraction: nature. so we always look at the nature for make a new product. 77: Abstraction helps us to do engineering better. Objects are real and creating shapes from objects helps engineering to think better. Shaping thinking, creating multiple universes, more dimensions. 78, 79, İf- we didnt use abstraction. many things can not understandable for calculations. For example, when greeks found PI, abstraction helped to find this numberIt also helped for creating mathematical philosophy like quantum mathematics or etc. 80: it helps us think more creatively, that we can make problems compeltely in easier way. When we do abstraction the problem can be more clearly and we can find a solution to solve it fast. 81: \"Todays abstract math is tomorrows applied math. For less effort we used abstraction. We can guess something, for example distance between Earth and Moon. Approximation helped us. Instant of change and Calculus\". 82. Abstraction helps engineer to think more openly and it make us generalize the things that we thought. There are things in World that can be represantive. by abstraction It make easier to think and solve the problems sought to those problems. If we don't teach the computer what it should know, we can't make it work. For example, we should teach computer that what color or shine is? 83. abstraction helps us in many ways in science, Not only engineering. Also, we use abstraction in math and mathematical expressions. We calculate very big numbers, distances. Science is abstract description, mathematics using nature. 84. \"Abstraction help us about thinking and solving problems. In the other hand, abstraction helps us convert abstraction math to applied math. So abstraction makes us strong against problems. It contributed creating new technologies and fields\". 85. \"It helps to imagine problems as models and helps to find logical solutions for real life problems And also it helps to think theoretically and obtain new formulas and relations\". 86. Abstraction provide us more exact conclusuions. like Abstraction help us to eliminate wrong results and trying to reach perfect result. 87. Observing nature and finding some problems are fundamental steps of the science. Every day we solve a lot of problems. Engineers also must solve this problems. Abstraction helps us do engineering better because in daily life we observe the nature, find the problem and abstract the things. When we find problem we should think about how can we solve it. That moment we need to abstract it, Predict what kind of problem is, and our approach should be correct. Today we abstract some problems, tomorrow problems will be applied. 88- 89. We can't explain our theories or plans without abstractionFor example, we all know the fact that if you throw a ball to air, it fallsBut we can't explain the mathematical truth of this eventTo explain it we use abstractionIn engineering it's similar, because if you want to invent something first you have to plan and calculate things. for those you must use numbers at least. and as we know, the numbers are abstraction. we use it everywhere in engineeringAlso the future engineers can look back and inspire from them so they will be able to invent better things. 90. abstraction helps us about fictioning the function in our mind and it is important to engineering because today s abstract thinking, tomorrow s reality. 91. \"it make us abstract issue of real life in your head by math \". 92. Abstraction help us to predict of the problem, Observe the nature and find the. with abstraction of the problem And solution of abstraction we trying to fins rational answer for problem. Also, abstraction made of Mathematics. 93. Abstraction is a method which we can think no existing object or content. Because of this We can planing building a structer without actually build. thanks to abstraction. 94. Abstraction is an indispensable tool in the engineering process. Engineers can improve their ability to relate physically distinct conceptsAbstracting concrete events. 95: Abstraction: remove the connections to real world and make them generic so that we can think processes and make operations simply. Important theorems and rules, generally based on abstract math. Today's abstract mats is tomorrows applied math. So we are using rules, informations and theorms which discovered by abstraction years ago and it helps us for better engineering. 96- 97, becuse we learned how to brtter wtih limtes and this make us think about it. 98- 99. they practice agriculture and they calculating abstract things. 100 helps us to think more efficiently and more creatively and helps us to solve the problems by different ways and testing methods to solve problems. 101. Zero is the most important abstraction. Defining something that does not exist always was one of the biggest question marks in people's mind, even back in Ancient Greece. However, now we know that in binary, in computers' life language, zero is one of the most important aspect. Things exist and they don't binary and, in it's essence, zero. let's us define those that do not exist Whenever we code something that has no value, something that has no name. 0 is one of the most used defining methods in engineering. Zero volt energy means we don't have any electric. If we have zero amount of a material, that building can't use that material. In essence, engineering is having one thing and not having the other one. Zero is the name we give to those we do not have. 102: \"Abstraction helps to us, like thinking about the zero\"\"0\"\"Because zero is nothing, but we can think about zero. It is not just that We should think about. MathMath is meanless if we can not think about itLike in integer and limit, you should think infinity and approaching to infinityThere is a lot examples. Today's abstraction is tommorow's applied Math \". 103: If there is a problem, we can take it into an abstractio form and solve it with using mathematics formulas. It helps us to think about a solution. 104: It is really important because we need to start from thinking, And abstraction help us to see what is our plan and what are we going to do. It give us a logic and ideas. There is a saying which is: \"Todays abstract math is tomorrows applied math. \" For example, if we are planning to make mobile app, first we need to make abstraction, which is define what we are going to use for technology. Or it is also same with classes. in programming to, we are doing abstraction. for example, we have users, so we need to define usernames and surnames, and it is the abstraction, It is like blueprinting. 105: Abstraction is turning real life problems into the ones that we can solve on our minds. That includes turning them into a mathematical ones as well. So abstraction helps us do engineering better, because we can actually do calculations if we abstract real life problems into the ones that we can solve. 106: We can apply maths in something we can face in daily life. We can abstract a problem in to smaller pieces and its easier the solveand we can apply maths to this problem. 107, it is modelling the structures and that helps to engineer. engineer solves problems and thinks better with abstraction. 108: \"abstraction is making together things to get them understand easily. it's like you have something smaller and you put a few of them together and you get a bigger thing and you use the bigger thing for your next project instead of using small thing again and again. for example, you have a function in a program, you just call it when you need it. you're not typing the commands that inside the that function again and again. so in that way engineering, math, physic became more understandable and easy to use and they put real life problems into math. that is abstraction\". 109: Todays abstract math. tomorrows applied mathIn the early parts of project. if engineer thinks abstractly, next moves can be easy and engineer can make next stepes more easy. Abstract thinking is predicting. 110. We can think things better with abstraction, for example on mathematics. if we use abstraction, we can applie it in programsrobots and etc. 111, It helps us to think and be creativeAnd helps us find solutions to the problems we cant solve by simply testing, such as infinite problems. 112, We can easily understand the problems with abstraction because its help us to imagine the problem in our mindİt. helps us a lot because engineer must solve problems quickly and the best way he/she can. 113. I wish to start a sentence: Todays abstract math, tomorrows practic math. It means that we need to first bring an idea, with abstraction wheter or not possible. For example, Jules Verne: when he first wrote to \"Ay'a Yolculuk\" he seen to other people as crazy or abstract, but his dream comes true after decades. The point I'm trying to make here is that as engineer, we mostly cant do things that doesnt thinked, and in the process of thinking these things, abstraction is crutial. 114, Abstraction means solving the real life problems with using our minds. Abstraction help us the generilaze our problems and make a solution from our knowledge. With using abstraction we can make our disicinous more easier. 115. abstraction makes us generilze and think out of the box. we can makes theories without any information and prove the hypotesis. 116: Abstraction helps us solve real life problems. with mathematics and calculus We abstract the information on mechanics and apply the information to real life problems. It helps us approximate the solution better. Archimedes used this on approximating pi. 117, ıf. you had a problem. you should understand that in that helps you to convert it to mathematic, mathematical language. otherwise you cant abstarct things. procrastination by infinitly instant changes. cumulative informations helps ıf. you had three things: square, triangle and circle. ıf. you dont abstract them. you cant solve and explain infinity problems. 118- 119, We can abstract mathemathical things from their physical bindings and make them more general so that we can use it for more problems. 120. Since abstraction is a process of conceptualizing things, it simplifies things and gives us a different perspective to provide a clearer approachIt turns a big problem into a smaller problem. 121. When we have a problem, we can abstract it so that it can become simplified, which makes us understand the problems better and come up with solutions easier. 122. If we know the how inside of the job works, we can do better at outside of the job tooWhen we abstrac a machine or a job we can learn about. how is it doing that thing inside of the machine? 123, It helps us to see the problem's solutions in different waysIt also helps us to create new ideas and solutionsAnd sometimes, when calculating is limited, it helps us to think in different parallelsSo since engineering is a job that needs creativity and maybe a bit overthinkingan engineer should learn and know how to abstract something in their mind. 124. Of course it increased the limits of our brains and our imagination. But the real reason why abstraction helped us is not using any tools. when we are doing abstraction, You can approximately calculate the rocks in the Konyaaltı just in your mind. In this situation, thinking about something that needs math or physics is getting easier to get the results. That takes engineering abilities in our mind to different level. By that we never wait for a calculator to do something about engineering. And also it make us think hard things as a quick, easy problems. 125. It helps us thinking theoretically. It generalizes the idea/problem. 126. Abstraction provide easier way to do engineering. We can imagine and then write it by codes so that important work emerge. For instance, let us think a shop. This shop needs a programme because they cannot follow the their stocks. An computer engineer for solving this problem. imagine and can improve an application. 127, to solve a nature problem with math. firstly we can understand it and we can understand it in real. but we can apply this to math because in math there are many answers. so we firstly abtraction a problem and then we can applied to math this problem. 128: Abstraction helps us engineers with preparing algorithms to our problems. It helps us think about the problem first and how to solve it. 129, Abstraction is taking the problems in nature and trying to solve them with symbols. Mathematic is a perfect way to abstract a problem. In engineering we have to come up with functions to solve problems. These functions are mathematical problems. Therefore we always abstract our problems to solve them. 130, by making people think efficiently. for example, there is a saying: \"todays abstraction math is tomorrows applied math\", which means the mathematical terms we are thinking about but cant really comprehend today, for example some kind of paradoxes or some theorems that are not proven yet, will possibly be taught at high schools in the future. So its a cumulative thing. The abstraction we do today is going to help the engineers in the future. 131, Engineers need to prove their. it is helping us while we are proving something. 132. It helps us to find solutions to specifically physical problems. Abstracting is making problems easier to solve while using logic, physics, instantaneous values and mathematics, and especially calculus. We can use abstraction, then differentiation and integral so that measurement and engineering is easier. 133. Abstraction in mathematics helped in a good way to engineering better. Also, the way we think and the way see today is more beyond the space and time. It helped us to make sense things we cant actually see in reality. 134. Abstraction helps us to understand better axioms. Today's abstract math is tomorrow's applied math. We understand better with formulas. We need to start thinking and to do that we need to understand what we are supposed to think. 135. When trying to solve a problem through engineering, one can't always have a solid physical sight to think or calculate something beforehand. Maths is the language of engineering and physics and helps us to think and visualize in an abstract way. that could prevent giant mistakes and accidents. 136. \"Todays abstract math is tomorrows engineering math. Abstraction helps us to use unkown things\". 137. That makes easier to predict the next step and think about a problem and its solution. 138. We can abstract some physical things to Mathematical or other Scientific models with abstraction So it can help us to understand and make better industrial or daily things. We can do engineering better thanks to abstraction. 139- Helps engineers foresee the problems and makes it possible to take precautions in order to solve the problem before it happens. 140: When we abstract something before we work on it, it is more easy to get over this problem and cheaper and time-saver because we first use imagination. so the problem can be more solvable and our approach to problem become more fast. 141, They can think correctly of calculations. Abstraction provided the abstract math become the applied math which we use todayin modern system. Also there is a saying: ''Today's abstract math is tomorrow' applied math''. Also, algebra is big effect in the engineering. Al kwharizmi is the father of algebra. 142, We can imagine the problem in our head by abstraction. For example, we can take an easy real-life problem and transfer it to in our head. By that way problem will get easier. This will make think and discuss better.

Engineers can use this for calculating abstract things. This helps for engineers to solving abstract problems. abstraction is useful for think easily. 2: \"İnvested Zero and then invested number. First of all binary system. then we calculate some science and math problems with this invested \". 3: there is a famous line: today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\' s applied, Which means that we developed math and better way to express things with abstract math. 4: Abstraction is one of the greatest tool of the engineer. By abstracting a problem we can solve little pieces of a bigger problem and connect all of the at the end. 5: \"Before, abstract Math is today\\'s proven science\". Some ideas can be abstract now. however, it might be proven by other scientists in the future. So it is important to get a development. 6: with abstraction we can understand things that difficualt to understandd. approximation law by infinity, instant change, abstract predict interest, approximation, senate tragedy, deomocracy. 7- 8: \"Zero is representive abstraction. Thus calculating and engineering are better \". 9: \"Nothingness or having nothing. It gives rise. the ability for a common person to be able to do mathematics isn’t. Before it, mathematicians struggled to perform the simplest arithmetic calculations. zero helps generalize nothingness\". 10: it helps us to make calculations calculating more easily. it helps us to generalize things. for instance, before the invention of 0, they just use nothing. invention of zero helps generalizing and representing nothingness. we observe nature and convert it to theoric information. 11: \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. Everything is more easier with abstract math. \". 12: with abstraction you can understand examples and problem time in engineering process. thorugh abstraction when you solved problem so you will be able translate problem which solved from one branch of engineering into anothers. so you will gain time and money because you won\\'t spend money and time to solve them again. 13: \"Abstraction is important because algorithm Engineers can see something but they don\\'t understand something. what can they understand? send to some object they can easily use to understand and predict\". 14- 15, \"because abstraction helps us to think that we will do before doing it. it shows us what we do actually but not completed. it decreases the cost of product\". 16: \"How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? Old people knows to: \"\"How can we add something from past\"\" and they are really good searcher. because of that. their engineering was good: Egypt, Greeks, Rome\". 17: to solve any problem in life, first you gotta abstract it to the formal math language. and also abstraction helps us to put things in groups, naturel numbersfull numbers. those all are kind a abstraction. even one of the most significiant invention of math, the zero, is the most important abstracton example in math. it helped us to create 10 based system. with that way we could define really big quantities and got many, much benefits. 18: abstraction help us when we need calculate maths, physics problem without absraction. we cannot do this thing. for example, if we calculate diameter, a radius or something liike that we need abstactionand this tihng help us engineerto creatvive things, for example coding and thinking about coding, deep thinking, alll of this thing s abstarction. 19, 20, For example, zero. Zero actually meanings nothing. it is abstract maths But with zero you can do many calculations for engineering easily. On the other, and we used abstraction to solve some physical problems, We abstract the physical problem and solve them with using some mathematical methods. It is quite important for engineering. We can solve some problems better with abstraction. it is really important for the engineering. 21: \"solving problems easily with abstraction. Engineering handle the problems if problems selected one by one. What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Goverment? What is the role of the theater in the Ancient Greece and Rome. How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth\". 22: Abstraction is generalising complex things. Abstract maths helps us to understand enginnering better. For example, 0 and 1(binary digits) makes easy to understand computer And people develope new computer language using abstraction And we can understand computer more easy. 23: Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. I mean color of shoe has no meaning for computer unless we teach it via usage of abstraction technique. For example, invention of zero is also type of abstraction (that is comes from Indıan religion \"Nirvana\"). Anything you see in the real world can be represented on computer. via using Abstraction We can represent their functions and ability. Being representetif of something allows us to get everything from real world via abstraction. For example, let\\'s assume you have a car İn computer science you can represent it with usage of classes. also you can create example of that class. Class can have field and fuctions of it represent thing. 24: its help to imagine. 25: Abstraction is helping us for be good engineerThanks to abstraction we can use thinking more analyticalAnd again thanks to abstraction we can use zero in our current counting systemBecause abstraction is helping us to think about nothingness and existence. 26. \"How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? It makes simple, do that It help us the solutions for questions. abstraction is a thinking freely \". 27. with using abstraction we can shorten the average time we\\'re going to spend on a work. its simply more efficient. 28. \" How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? Roma\\'s civilization engineering for military. Greeks used to mathobserve and explain for science Cause and effect(Aristotle). Use the math, prove, Observe nature and explain Science can find all Aristotles deductives(Tümdengelim) \". 29. \"How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? improve, establish, invented observation, approximation, approximate politic, economy, infrastructure, law, people, conflict of interest, play, rule, predict abstract conclusion. astronomy, Galileo, newton, humanity, democrat destruction, public administration, concrete Julian calendar, Gregorian calendar, punishment, surgery, math, tragedy, theater, formal, logical, discuss war, perform science, monarchy, powers of kings, nature, philosophy, approach physics, arbitrarily classification, audience, rights of law. establish invented, try. What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth? What is the role of the theater in the Ancient Greece and Rome? What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Government view\". 30. If there is a problem and we have to solve it, we should abstract it in our mind. So this helps us to solve this problem easily. An engineer is always going to face many of problems and wants to solve them Because it is his job To make easy the solutions. abstraction is very helpful selection, For instance, an civil engineer might face to a problem when construct an build. If he/she use abstraction - he think the problem in his/her mind as abstract - the problem will be easier to solve. 31. For example, in real world the thinks aren\\'t perfectly shaped, But in geometry we can assume that there are perfect shapes and can do calculations on them. 32: Abstraction is important because people use that to improve scienceİf. people improved the science, engineering would be better. 33: Abstraction helps us do engineering better. zero limit, infinity. We know something there, but we do not know how much. Approximation, science, inconsistency, arbitraryInconsistency between themInduction of ideasRome, Ancient GreeceFunction 34: \"abstraction helps us think better of problem and find best solution way engineering better. \". 35. It provides us thinking more efficient and then we do engineering better. 36: Abstraction helps us do engineering betterBecause abstraction is important at the theaterExample: Romans theater and Greeks theater is differentGreek\\'s theater platform is circleAll of them helps us do engineering better. 37. \"the formal lanaguge to computers is binaray, which is passing on zeros and ones, and zero is an abstraction \". 38, 39, \"We can calculate easier with abstractionToday some things easier to understand. with abstraction. We can easily imagine the some thingsAbstraction make easier the engineering. \". 40. in early ages there were very little amounts of knowledge and engineering systems, so abstraction helped them with creativity, solving problems, creating something. All of them could be exist with thinking abstract. 41. \"Zero is the most abstraction. Zero had been invented for esaier calculations and abstract mathematic. for example. when ı use computer, most users unaware the inner workings in the computer. I can learn this because of abstraction \". 42, 43, Abstraction helps to avoid time wasting and prevents problems before they happens, because we imagine before we take action and see those problems, so we prevent those problems. 44: Abstraction is a thinking way. It help us to find solutions to specifically or hard physicial problems. You can abstract a problem basically in your mind and you can solve this problem on your mind. After that you can solve this problem on real life because you find a way with thinking and you know what to do. 45: In some problems we may not have as many as matter to solve the problemSo abstraction helps us to solve our problem without even having the materialWith this way, now, engineering came so far. 46. \"\\'Today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'. We can use 0 and calculate the equation by abstraction, and then we can use this thing in applied math and engineering like Pyramids\". 47. \"Some calculating needs more effort than ordinary human can. So in this reason, especially in math, people had to assume some steps that they can\\'t do in order to complete the thing that they started, For example calculating PI. Also, reality has some limit that you can\\'t surpass, but abstraction can make you feel free when you think about something. \". 48. Abstraction helps us solve a real world, physical problem by making it an abstract one, one that is solvable intellectually without any physical work. 49. They could imagine better and cleverly. 50. The inventions are constructed in the mind of their inventor and we say abstraction it. Therefore, if we make a lot of abstraction about the invention or machine, we can have the best engineering devices. so engineering developing thanks to abstraction. 51. we descripe to hard thing and it will be easy for us. 52. We can say: abstraction is symbol of nothingnessSometimes we can not explain everything with mathematical symbols, so abstraction help us about thisAbstraction is also generelazition and it is important to engineering. 53. Abstraction provides us more exact conclusions on our calculations and studies in the branchs of science. It helps us deeply and more effective work while we working on problems. 54. It helps us solve our problems in our head without actually doing some difficult experiments, And It also helps us understand some theories that are not suitable for modelizing in real world, such as binary system or transistors that says 1 is on and 0 is off, which is related to electric currency. 55. we do not take the data we do not need throw them away, so we can focus on data we need clearly. 56. Today we abstract our ideas and tomorrow we can execute our ideas for real in engineering, because if we want the make something happens, we need to think what to do, We need to imagine and after that we can do things that we imagined. 57. for example, we had started thinking better, so we did smart works. 58. With an Abstractionit possible to explain experiments or research that couldn\\'t observe the results. the in physical lifeIt makes our job easierWith using this method used to understand and predict. bring more rational answer to usprogressive and cumulative science improved with that way. 59: Existing in thought or an idea but not have a physical formWe could calculate the area of house by thinking abstractFor example thinking the area of house as a square. 60. There is a saying: \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\". As we understand from this quote, abstraction is the step right before the real application. In order to invent new devices, technologies, etc. we should take the abstract and apply it by using sciences such as physics and math. Calculus is also related. Isaac Newton did studies on abstract math and couldn\\'t apply all of them into reality, but today many works of engineering is based on Newton\\'s studies. 61. with abstraction, humanity can built building more easy and stronger. 62. We found zero with abstraction and we can describe it with use abstraction. Then we solved a lot of problem with use zero. Also, we can find answer to difficult questions. We can solve them easly. 63. Abstraction is very important for us because we need to understand how to solve a problem. Especially maths and physics can do it. so if we learn them we can be better, engineer better. 64. It help us make problem to things that we can solve, For instance calculating the size of pyramids. We abstract the problem into the our mind so that we can figure it out how we can do. 65: It helps us think more creatively. thus we can make complicated problems to simply ones. Then we solve the problems easily or we understend nature. 66: we are using this predict and abstract some ideas for provefor example we want to make new, invent or workfirstly we abstract that matter and then we aplly. 67: Abstraction is an obligation because we know a lot of theorems, rules and calculations, but all of them are general. But when we have a real problem we should transform the base problem into a case (rule, theorem or equation) and we always use abstraction to do this. abstraction is transforming the problem unsolvable to solvable. So if we focus on this basics, abstraction can helps us better. 68: Abstraction turns a problem to mathematically form and we can use calculus. 69: We imagine and generalize problems in our mind. then we solve it in our mindsThen we understand the problem and solutionafter that we will be able to find a strict solution or proven function. 70: \"There is a saying: \"\"today\\'s abstract mathematic is future\\'s applied mathematic\"\", so every abstract idea can be applied and usefulabstraction is necessary for engineering\". 71: Things in real world can be respresented by abstraction. The thing what I am trying to say is color of a car has no meaning for computer unless we teach it with right abstraction technique. 72, For example, in Abstraction means removal of details. Essentially you remove unnecessary details to get a clear view. Typically you want to be able to analyze/demonstrate/prove/communicate/verify/validate a set of properties based on informed design decisions. Seeing the design in the code is like trying to perceive the forest while walking among the trees. You see cues but not the forest. Different purposes need different abstractions. 73: Abstraction helps to us about thinking. When we use it we can do anything as mathematically what we cannot feel in realistic world. So we can think about infinity and use it. We can also use zero in problem solving or calculating. 74: It helps us to do the distinct disicplines better. For instance, people used it to laid of foundations, mathematics and engineering. Also Before, Civilizations of Ancient Greek used abstraction and abstract mathematics to give a meaning of numbers and explain the science a bit rationallyAbstraction is a kind of bridge for the applied maths and engineering and there is a saying: \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math, Tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'\\'. It show us The science is cumulative and progressive. 75: \"We can not doing every thing with applied science, but if we use abstraction we can imagine it easily. for example, zero: we can not feeling or touching, but we can imagine with abstraction and we use in applied engineering qualitative to quantitative\". 76. we use math for abstraction: nature. so we always look at the nature for make a new product. 77: Abstraction helps us to do engineering better. Objects are real and creating shapes from objects helps engineering to think better. Shaping thinking, creating multiple universes, more dimensions. 78, 79, İf- we didnt use abstraction. many things can not understandable for calculations. For example, when greeks found PI, abstraction helped to find this numberIt also helped for creating mathematical philosophy like quantum mathematics or etc. 80: it helps us think more creatively, that we can make problems compeltely in easier way. When we do abstraction the problem can be more clearly and we can find a solution to solve it fast. 81: \"Todays abstract math is tomorrows applied math. For less effort we used abstraction. We can guess something, for example distance between Earth and Moon. Approximation helped us. Instant of change and Calculus\". 82. Abstraction helps engineer to think more openly and it make us generalize the things that we thought. There are things in World that can be represantive. by abstraction It make easier to think and solve the problems sought to those problems. If we don\\'t teach the computer what it should know, we can\\'t make it work. For example, we should teach computer that what color or shine is? 83. abstraction helps us in many ways in science, Not only engineering. Also, we use abstraction in math and mathematical expressions. We calculate very big numbers, distances. Science is abstract description, mathematics using nature. 84. \"Abstraction help us about thinking and solving problems. In the other hand, abstraction helps us convert abstraction math to applied math. So abstraction makes us strong against problems. It contributed creating new technologies and fields\". 85. \"It helps to imagine problems as models and helps to find logical solutions for real life problems And also it helps to think theoretically and obtain new formulas and relations\". 86. Abstraction provide us more exact conclusuions. like Abstraction help us to eliminate wrong results and trying to reach perfect result. 87. Observing nature and finding some problems are fundamental steps of the science. Every day we solve a lot of problems. Engineers also must solve this problems. Abstraction helps us do engineering better because in daily life we observe the nature, find the problem and abstract the things. When we find problem we should think about how can we solve it. That moment we need to abstract it, Predict what kind of problem is, and our approach should be correct. Today we abstract some problems, tomorrow problems will be applied. 88- 89. We can\\'t explain our theories or plans without abstractionFor example, we all know the fact that if you throw a ball to air, it fallsBut we can\\'t explain the mathematical truth of this eventTo explain it we use abstractionIn engineering it\\'s similar, because if you want to invent something first you have to plan and calculate things. for those you must use numbers at least. and as we know, the numbers are abstraction. we use it everywhere in engineeringAlso the future engineers can look back and inspire from them so they will be able to invent better things. 90. abstraction helps us about fictioning the function in our mind and it is important to engineering because today s abstract thinking, tomorrow s reality. 91. \"it make us abstract issue of real life in your head by math \". 92. Abstraction help us to predict of the problem, Observe the nature and find the. with abstraction of the problem And solution of abstraction we trying to fins rational answer for problem. Also, abstraction made of Mathematics. 93. Abstraction is a method which we can think no existing object or content. Because of this We can planing building a structer without actually build. thanks to abstraction. 94. Abstraction is an indispensable tool in the engineering process. Engineers can improve their ability to relate physically distinct conceptsAbstracting concrete events. 95: Abstraction: remove the connections to real world and make them generic so that we can think processes and make operations simply. Important theorems and rules, generally based on abstract math. Today\\'s abstract mats is tomorrows applied math. So we are using rules, informations and theorms which discovered by abstraction years ago and it helps us for better engineering. 96- 97, becuse we learned how to brtter wtih limtes and this make us think about it. 98- 99. they practice agriculture and they calculating abstract things. 100 helps us to think more efficiently and more creatively and helps us to solve the problems by different ways and testing methods to solve problems. 101. Zero is the most important abstraction. Defining something that does not exist always was one of the biggest question marks in people\\'s mind, even back in Ancient Greece. However, now we know that in binary, in computers\\' life language, zero is one of the most important aspect. Things exist and they don\\'t binary and, in it\\'s essence, zero. let\\'s us define those that do not exist Whenever we code something that has no value, something that has no name. 0 is one of the most used defining methods in engineering. Zero volt energy means we don\\'t have any electric. If we have zero amount of a material, that building can\\'t use that material. In essence, engineering is having one thing and not having the other one. Zero is the name we give to those we do not have. 102: \"Abstraction helps to us, like thinking about the zero\"\"0\"\"Because zero is nothing, but we can think about zero. It is not just that We should think about. MathMath is meanless if we can not think about itLike in integer and limit, you should think infinity and approaching to infinityThere is a lot examples. Today\\'s abstraction is tommorow\\'s applied Math \". 103: If there is a problem, we can take it into an abstractio form and solve it with using mathematics formulas. It helps us to think about a solution. 104: It is really important because we need to start from thinking, And abstraction help us to see what is our plan and what are we going to do. It give us a logic and ideas. There is a saying which is: \"Todays abstract math is tomorrows applied math. \" For example, if we are planning to make mobile app, first we need to make abstraction, which is define what we are going to use for technology. Or it is also same with classes. in programming to, we are doing abstraction. for example, we have users, so we need to define usernames and surnames, and it is the abstraction, It is like blueprinting. 105: Abstraction is turning real life problems into the ones that we can solve on our minds. That includes turning them into a mathematical ones as well. So abstraction helps us do engineering better, because we can actually do calculations if we abstract real life problems into the ones that we can solve. 106: We can apply maths in something we can face in daily life. We can abstract a problem in to smaller pieces and its easier the solveand we can apply maths to this problem. 107, it is modelling the structures and that helps to engineer. engineer solves problems and thinks better with abstraction. 108: \"abstraction is making together things to get them understand easily. it\\'s like you have something smaller and you put a few of them together and you get a bigger thing and you use the bigger thing for your next project instead of using small thing again and again. for example, you have a function in a program, you just call it when you need it. you\\'re not typing the commands that inside the that function again and again. so in that way engineering, math, physic became more understandable and easy to use and they put real life problems into math. that is abstraction\". 109: Todays abstract math. tomorrows applied mathIn the early parts of project. if engineer thinks abstractly, next moves can be easy and engineer can make next stepes more easy. Abstract thinking is predicting. 110. We can think things better with abstraction, for example on mathematics. if we use abstraction, we can applie it in programsrobots and etc. 111, It helps us to think and be creativeAnd helps us find solutions to the problems we cant solve by simply testing, such as infinite problems. 112, We can easily understand the problems with abstraction because its help us to imagine the problem in our mindİt. helps us a lot because engineer must solve problems quickly and the best way he/she can. 113. I wish to start a sentence: Todays abstract math, tomorrows practic math. It means that we need to first bring an idea, with abstraction wheter or not possible. For example, Jules Verne: when he first wrote to \"Ay\\'a Yolculuk\" he seen to other people as crazy or abstract, but his dream comes true after decades. The point I\\'m trying to make here is that as engineer, we mostly cant do things that doesnt thinked, and in the process of thinking these things, abstraction is crutial. 114, Abstraction means solving the real life problems with using our minds. Abstraction help us the generilaze our problems and make a solution from our knowledge. With using abstraction we can make our disicinous more easier. 115. abstraction makes us generilze and think out of the box. we can makes theories without any information and prove the hypotesis. 116: Abstraction helps us solve real life problems. with mathematics and calculus We abstract the information on mechanics and apply the information to real life problems. It helps us approximate the solution better. Archimedes used this on approximating pi. 117, ıf. you had a problem. you should understand that in that helps you to convert it to mathematic, mathematical language. otherwise you cant abstarct things. procrastination by infinitly instant changes. cumulative informations helps ıf. you had three things: square, triangle and circle. ıf. you dont abstract them. you cant solve and explain infinity problems. 118- 119, We can abstract mathemathical things from their physical bindings and make them more general so that we can use it for more problems. 120. Since abstraction is a process of conceptualizing things, it simplifies things and gives us a different perspective to provide a clearer approachIt turns a big problem into a smaller problem. 121. When we have a problem, we can abstract it so that it can become simplified, which makes us understand the problems better and come up with solutions easier. 122. If we know the how inside of the job works, we can do better at outside of the job tooWhen we abstrac a machine or a job we can learn about. how is it doing that thing inside of the machine? 123, It helps us to see the problem\\'s solutions in different waysIt also helps us to create new ideas and solutionsAnd sometimes, when calculating is limited, it helps us to think in different parallelsSo since engineering is a job that needs creativity and maybe a bit overthinkingan engineer should learn and know how to abstract something in their mind. 124. Of course it increased the limits of our brains and our imagination. But the real reason why abstraction helped us is not using any tools. when we are doing abstraction, You can approximately calculate the rocks in the Konyaaltı just in your mind. In this situation, thinking about something that needs math or physics is getting easier to get the results. That takes engineering abilities in our mind to different level. By that we never wait for a calculator to do something about engineering. And also it make us think hard things as a quick, easy problems. 125. It helps us thinking theoretically. It generalizes the idea/problem. 126. Abstraction provide easier way to do engineering. We can imagine and then write it by codes so that important work emerge. For instance, let us think a shop. This shop needs a programme because they cannot follow the their stocks. An computer engineer for solving this problem. imagine and can improve an application. 127, to solve a nature problem with math. firstly we can understand it and we can understand it in real. but we can apply this to math because in math there are many answers. so we firstly abtraction a problem and then we can applied to math this problem. 128: Abstraction helps us engineers with preparing algorithms to our problems. It helps us think about the problem first and how to solve it. 129, Abstraction is taking the problems in nature and trying to solve them with symbols. Mathematic is a perfect way to abstract a problem. In engineering we have to come up with functions to solve problems. These functions are mathematical problems. Therefore we always abstract our problems to solve them. 130, by making people think efficiently. for example, there is a saying: \"todays abstraction math is tomorrows applied math\", which means the mathematical terms we are thinking about but cant really comprehend today, for example some kind of paradoxes or some theorems that are not proven yet, will possibly be taught at high schools in the future. So its a cumulative thing. The abstraction we do today is going to help the engineers in the future. 131, Engineers need to prove their. it is helping us while we are proving something. 132. It helps us to find solutions to specifically physical problems. Abstracting is making problems easier to solve while using logic, physics, instantaneous values and mathematics, and especially calculus. We can use abstraction, then differentiation and integral so that measurement and engineering is easier. 133. Abstraction in mathematics helped in a good way to engineering better. Also, the way we think and the way see today is more beyond the space and time. It helped us to make sense things we cant actually see in reality. 134. Abstraction helps us to understand better axioms. Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. We understand better with formulas. We need to start thinking and to do that we need to understand what we are supposed to think. 135. When trying to solve a problem through engineering, one can\\'t always have a solid physical sight to think or calculate something beforehand. Maths is the language of engineering and physics and helps us to think and visualize in an abstract way. that could prevent giant mistakes and accidents. 136. \"Todays abstract math is tomorrows engineering math. Abstraction helps us to use unkown things\". 137. That makes easier to predict the next step and think about a problem and its solution. 138. We can abstract some physical things to Mathematical or other Scientific models with abstraction So it can help us to understand and make better industrial or daily things. We can do engineering better thanks to abstraction. 139- Helps engineers foresee the problems and makes it possible to take precautions in order to solve the problem before it happens. 140: When we abstract something before we work on it, it is more easy to get over this problem and cheaper and time-saver because we first use imagination. so the problem can be more solvable and our approach to problem become more fast. 141, They can think correctly of calculations. Abstraction provided the abstract math become the applied math which we use todayin modern system. Also there is a saying: \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\' applied math\\'\\'. Also, algebra is big effect in the engineering. Al kwharizmi is the father of algebra. 142, We can imagine the problem in our head by abstraction. For example, we can take an easy real-life problem and transfer it to in our head. By that way problem will get easier. This will make think and discuss better.

Abstraction is one of the greatest tool of the engineer. By abstracting a problem we can solve little pieces of a bigger problem and connect all of the at the end.  \"Before, abstract Math is today\\'s proven science\". Some ideas can be abstract now. however, it might be proven by other scientists in the future. So it is important to get a development.  with abstraction we can understand things that difficualt to understandd. approximation law by infinity, instant change, abstract predict interest, approximation, senate tragedy, deomocracy. -  \"Zero is representive abstraction. Thus calculating and engineering are better \".  \"Nothingness or having nothing. It gives rise. the ability for a common person to be able to do mathematics isn’t. Before it, mathematicians struggled to perform the simplest arithmetic calculations. zero helps generalize nothingness\".  it helps us to make calculations calculating more easily. it helps us to generalize things. for instance, before the invention of , they just use nothing. invention of zero helps generalizing and representing nothingness. we observe nature and convert it to theoric information.  \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. Everything is more easier with abstract math. \".  with abstraction you can understand examples and problem time in engineering process. thorugh abstraction when you solved problem so you will be able translate problem which solved from one branch of engineering into anothers. so you will gain time and money because you won\\'t spend money and time to solve them again.  \"Abstraction is important because algorithm Engineers can see something but they don\\'t understand something. what can they understand? send to some object they can easily use to understand and predict\". - , \"because abstraction helps us to think that we will do before doing it. it shows us what we do actually but not completed. it decreases the cost of product\".  \"How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? Old people knows to \"\"How can we add something from past\"\" and they are really good searcher. because of that. their engineering was good Egypt, Greeks, Rome\".  to solve any problem in life, first you gotta abstract it to the formal math language. and also abstraction helps us to put things in groups, naturel numbersfull numbers. those all are kind a abstraction. even one of the most significiant invention of math, the zero, is the most important abstracton example in math. it helped us to create  based system. with that way we could define really big quantities and got many, much benefits.  abstraction help us when we need calculate maths, physics problem without absraction. we cannot do this thing. for example, if we calculate diameter, a radius or something liike that we need abstactionand this tihng help us engineerto creatvive things, for example coding and thinking about coding, deep thinking, alll of this thing s abstarction. , , For example, zero. Zero actually meanings nothing. it is abstract maths But with zero you can do many calculations for engineering easily. On the other, and we used abstraction to solve some physical problems, We abstract the physical problem and solve them with using some mathematical methods. It is quite important for engineering. We can solve some problems better with abstraction. it is really important for the engineering.  \"solving problems easily with abstraction. Engineering handle the problems if problems selected one by one. What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Goverment? What is the role of the theater in the Ancient Greece and Rome. How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth\".  Abstraction is generalising complex things. Abstract maths helps us to understand enginnering better. For example,  and (binary digits) makes easy to understand computer And people develope new computer language using abstraction And we can understand computer more easy.  Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. I mean color of shoe has no meaning for computer unless we teach it via usage of abstraction technique. For example, invention of zero is also type of abstraction (that is comes from Indıan religion \"Nirvana\"). Anything you see in the real world can be represented on computer. via using Abstraction We can represent their functions and ability. Being representetif of something allows us to get everything from real world via abstraction. For example, let\\'s assume you have a car İn computer science you can represent it with usage of classes. also you can create example of that class. Class can have field and fuctions of it represent thing.  its help to imagine.  Abstraction is helping us for be good engineerThanks to abstraction we can use thinking more analyticalAnd again thanks to abstraction we can use zero in our current counting systemBecause abstraction is helping us to think about nothingness and existence. . \"How does abstraction helps us do engineering better? It makes simple, do that It help us the solutions for questions. abstraction is a thinking freely \". . with using abstraction we can shorten the average time we\\'re going to spend on a work. its simply more efficient. . \" How does abstraction helps us do engineering better?

If there is a problem and we have to solve it, we should abstract it in our mind. So this helps us to solve this problem easily. An engineer is always going to face many of problems and wants to solve them Because it is his job To make easy the solutions. abstraction is very helpful selection, For instance, an civil engineer might face to a problem when construct an build. If he/she use abstraction - he think the problem in his/her mind as abstract - the problem will be easier to solve. . For example, in real world the thinks aren\\'t perfectly shaped, But in geometry we can assume that there are perfect shapes and can do calculations on them.  Abstraction is important because people use that to improve scienceİf. people improved the science, engineering would be better.  Abstraction helps us do engineering better. zero limit, infinity. We know something there, but we do not know how much. Approximation, science, inconsistency, arbitraryInconsistency between themInduction of ideasRome, Ancient GreeceFunction  \"abstraction helps us think better of problem and find best solution way engineering better. \". . It provides us thinking more efficient and then we do engineering better.  Abstraction helps us do engineering betterBecause abstraction is important at the theaterExample Romans theater and Greeks theater is differentGreek\\'s theater platform is circleAll of them helps us do engineering better. . \"the formal lanaguge to computers is binaray, which is passing on zeros and ones, and zero is an abstraction \". , , \"We can calculate easier with abstractionToday some things easier to understand. with abstraction. We can easily imagine the some thingsAbstraction make easier the engineering. \". . in early ages there were very little amounts of knowledge and engineering systems, so abstraction helped them with creativity, solving problems, creating something. All of them could be exist with thinking abstract. . \"Zero is the most abstraction. Zero had been invented for esaier calculations and abstract mathematic. for example. when ı use computer, most users unaware the inner workings in the computer. I can learn this because of abstraction \". , , Abstraction helps to avoid time wasting and prevents problems before they happens, because we imagine before we take action and see those problems, so we prevent those problems.  Abstraction is a thinking way. It help us to find solutions to specifically or hard physicial problems. You can abstract a problem basically in your mind and you can solve this problem on your mind. After that you can solve this problem on real life because you find a way with thinking and you know what to do.  In some problems we may not have as many as matter to solve the problemSo abstraction helps us to solve our problem without even having the materialWith this way, now, engineering came so far. . \"\\'Today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'. We can use  and calculate the equation by abstraction, and then we can use this thing in applied math and engineering like Pyramids\". . \"Some calculating needs more effort than ordinary human can. So in this reason, especially in math, people had to assume some steps that they can\\'t do in order to complete the thing that they started, For example calculating PI. Also, reality has some limit that you can\\'t surpass, but abstraction can make you feel free when you think about something. \". . Abstraction helps us solve a real world, physical problem by making it an abstract one, one that is solvable intellectually without any physical work. . They could imagine better and cleverly. . The inventions are constructed in the mind of their inventor and we say abstraction it. Therefore, if we make a lot of abstraction about the invention or machine, we can have the best engineering devices. so engineering developing thanks to abstraction. . we descripe to hard thing and it will be easy for us. . We can say abstraction is symbol of nothingnessSometimes we can not explain everything with mathematical symbols, so abstraction help us about thisAbstraction is also generelazition and it is important to engineering. . Abstraction provides us more exact conclusions on our calculations and studies in the branchs of science. It helps us deeply and more effective work while we working on problems. . It helps us solve our problems in our head without actually doing some difficult experiments, And It also helps us understand some theories that are not suitable for modelizing in real world, such as binary system or transistors that says  is on and  is off, which is related to electric currency. . we do not take the data we do not need throw them away, so we can focus on data we need clearly. . Today we abstract our ideas and tomorrow we can execute our ideas for real in engineering, because if we want the make something happens, we need to think what to do, We need to imagine and after that we can do things that we imagined. . for example, we had started thinking better, so we did smart works. . With an Abstractionit possible to explain experiments or research that couldn\\'t observe the results. the in physical lifeIt makes our job easierWith using this method used to understand and predict. bring more rational answer to usprogressive and cumulative science improved with that way.  Existing in thought or an idea but not have a physical formWe could calculate the area of house by thinking abstractFor example thinking the area of house as a square. . There is a saying \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\". As we understand from this quote, abstraction is the step right before the real application. In order to invent new devices, technologies, etc. we should take the abstract and apply it by using sciences such as physics and math. Calculus is also related. Isaac Newton did studies on abstract math and couldn\\'t apply all of them into reality, but today many works of engineering is based on Newton\\'s studies. . with abstraction, humanity can built building more easy and stronger. . We found zero with abstraction and we can describe it with use abstraction. Then we solved a lot of problem with use zero. Also, we can find answer to difficult questions. We can solve them easly. . Abstraction is very important for us because we need to understand how to solve a problem. Especially maths and physics can do it. so if we learn them we can be better, engineer better. . It help us make problem to things that we can solve, For instance calculating the size of pyramids. We abstract the problem into the our mind so that we can figure it out how we can do.  It helps us think more creatively. thus we can make complicated problems to simply ones. Then we solve the problems easily or we understend nature.  we are using this predict and abstract some ideas for provefor example we want to make new, invent or workfirstly we abstract that matter and then we aplly.  Abstraction is an obligation because we know a lot of theorems, rules and calculations, but all of them are general. But when we have a real problem we should transform the base problem into a case (rule, theorem or equation) and we always use abstraction to do this. abstraction is transforming the problem unsolvable to solvable. So if we focus on this basics, abstraction can helps us better.  Abstraction turns a problem to mathematically form and we can use calculus.  We imagine and generalize problems in our mind. then we solve it in our mindsThen we understand the problem and solutionafter that we will be able to find a strict solution or proven function.  \"There is a saying \"\"today\\'s abstract mathematic is future\\'s applied mathematic\"\", so every abstract idea can be applied and usefulabstraction is necessary for engineering\".  Things in real world can be respresented by abstraction. The thing what I am trying to say is color of a car has no meaning for computer unless we teach it with right abstraction technique. , For example, in Abstraction means removal of details. Essentially you remove unnecessary details to get a clear view. Typically you want to be able to analyze/demonstrate/prove/communicate/verify/validate a set of properties based on informed design decisions. Seeing the design in the code is like trying to perceive the forest while walking among the trees. You see cues but not the forest. Different purposes need different abstractions.  Abstraction helps to us about thinking. When we use it we can do anything as mathematically what we cannot feel in realistic world. So we can think about infinity and use it. We can also use zero in problem solving or calculating.  It helps us to do the distinct disicplines better. For instance, people used it to laid of foundations, mathematics and engineering. Also Before, Civilizations of Ancient Greek used abstraction and abstract mathematics to give a meaning of numbers and explain the science a bit rationallyAbstraction is a kind of bridge for the applied maths and engineering and there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math, Tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'\\'. It show us The science is cumulative and progressive.  \"We can not doing every thing with applied science, but if we use abstraction we can imagine it easily. for example, zero we can not feeling or touching, but we can imagine with abstraction and we use in applied engineering qualitative to quantitative\". . we use math for abstraction nature. so we always look at the nature for make a new product.  Abstraction helps us to do engineering better. Objects are real and creating shapes from objects helps engineering to think better. Shaping thinking, creating multiple universes, more dimensions. , , İf- we didnt use abstraction. many things can not understandable for calculations. For example, when greeks found PI, abstraction helped to find this numberIt also helped for creating mathematical philosophy like quantum mathematics or etc.  it helps us think more creatively, that we can make problems compeltely in easier way. When we do abstraction the problem can be more clearly and we can find a solution to solve it fast.  \"Todays abstract math is tomorrows applied math. For less effort we used abstraction. We can guess something, for example distance between Earth and Moon. Approximation helped us. Instant of change and Calculus\". . Abstraction helps engineer to think more openly and it make us generalize the things that we thought. There are things in World that can be represantive. by abstraction It make easier to think and solve the problems sought to those problems. If we don\\'t teach the computer what it should know, we can\\'t make it work. For example, we should teach computer that what color or shine is? . abstraction helps us in many ways in science, Not only engineering. Also, we use abstraction in math and mathematical expressions. We calculate very big numbers, distances. Science is abstract description, mathematics using nature. . \"Abstraction help us about thinking and solving problems. In the other hand, abstraction helps us convert abstraction math to applied math. So abstraction makes us strong against problems. It contributed creating new technologies and fields\". . \"It helps to imagine problems as models and helps to find logical solutions for real life problems And also it helps to think theoretically and obtain new formulas and relations\". . Abstraction provide us more exact conclusuions. like Abstraction help us to eliminate wrong results and trying to reach perfect result. . Observing nature and finding some problems are fundamental steps of the science. Every day we solve a lot of problems. Engineers also must solve this problems. Abstraction helps us do engineering better because in daily life we observe the nature, find the problem and abstract the things. When we find problem we should think about how can we solve it. That moment we need to abstract it, Predict what kind of problem is, and our approach should be correct. Today we abstract some problems, tomorrow problems will be applied. - . We can\\'t explain our theories or plans without abstractionFor example, we all know the fact that if you throw a ball to air, it fallsBut we can\\'t explain the mathematical truth of this eventTo explain it we use abstractionIn engineering it\\'s similar, because if you want to invent something first you have to plan and calculate things. for those you must use numbers at least. and as we know, the numbers are abstraction. we use it everywhere in engineeringAlso the future engineers can look back and inspire from them so they will be able to invent better things. . abstraction helps us about fictioning the function in our mind and it is important to engineering because today s abstract thinking, tomorrow s reality. . \"it make us abstract issue of real life in your head by math \". . Abstraction help us to predict of the problem, Observe the nature and find the. with abstraction of the problem And solution of abstraction we trying to fins rational answer for problem. Also, abstraction made of Mathematics. . Abstraction is a method which we can think no existing object or content. Because of this We can planing building a structer without actually build. thanks to abstraction. . Abstraction is an indispensable tool in the engineering process. Engineers can improve their ability to relate physically distinct conceptsAbstracting concrete events.  Abstraction remove the connections to real world and make them generic so that we can think processes and make operations simply. Important theorems and rules, generally based on abstract math. Today\\'s abstract mats is tomorrows applied math. So we are using rules, informations and theorms which discovered by abstraction years ago and it helps us for better engineering. - , becuse we learned how to brtter wtih limtes and this make us think about it. - . they practice agriculture and they calculating abstract things.  helps us to think more efficiently and more creatively and helps us to solve the problems by different ways and testing methods to solve problems. . Zero is the most important abstraction. Defining something that does not exist always was one of the biggest question marks in people\\'s mind, even back in Ancient Greece. However, now we know that in binary, in computers\\' life language, zero is one of the most important aspect. Things exist and they don\\'t binary and, in it\\'s essence, zero. let\\'s us define those that do not exist Whenever we code something that has no value, something that has no name.  is one of the most used defining methods in engineering. Zero volt energy means we don\\'t have any electric. If we have zero amount of a material, that building can\\'t use that material. In essence, engineering is having one thing and not having the other one. Zero is the name we give to those we do not have.  \"Abstraction helps to us, like thinking about the zero\"\"\"\"Because zero is nothing, but we can think about zero. It is not just that We should think about. MathMath is meanless if we can not think about itLike in integer and limit, you should think infinity and approaching to infinityThere is a lot examples. Today\\'s abstraction is tommorow\\'s applied Math \".  If there is a problem, we can take it into an abstractio form and solve it with using mathematics formulas. It helps us to think about a solution.  It is really important because we need to start from thinking, And abstraction help us to see what is our plan and what are we going to do. It give us a logic and ideas. There is a saying which is \"Todays abstract math is tomorrows applied math. \" For example, if we are planning to make mobile app, first we need to make abstraction, which is define what we are going to use for technology. Or it is also same with classes. in programming to, we are doing abstraction. for example, we have users, so we need to define usernames and surnames, and it is the abstraction, It is like blueprinting.  Abstraction is turning real life problems into the ones that we can solve on our minds. That includes turning them into a mathematical ones as well. So abstraction helps us do engineering better, because we can actually do calculations if we abstract real life problems into the ones that we can solve.  We can apply maths in something we can face in daily life. We can abstract a problem in to smaller pieces and its easier the solveand we can apply maths to this problem. , it is modelling the structures and that helps to engineer. engineer solves problems and thinks better with abstraction.  \"abstraction is making together things to get them understand easily. it\\'s like you have something smaller and you put a few of them together and you get a bigger thing and you use the bigger thing for your next project instead of using small thing again and again. for example, you have a function in a program, you just call it when you need it. you\\'re not typing the commands that inside the that function again and again. so in that way engineering, math, physic became more understandable and easy to use and they put real life problems into math. that is abstraction\".  Todays abstract math. tomorrows applied mathIn the early parts of project. if engineer thinks abstractly, next moves can be easy and engineer can make next stepes more easy. Abstract thinking is predicting. . We can think things better with abstraction, for example on mathematics. if we use abstraction, we can applie it in programsrobots and etc. , It helps us to think and be creativeAnd helps us find solutions to the problems we cant solve by simply testing, such as infinite problems. , We can easily understand the problems with abstraction because its help us to imagine the problem in our mindİt. helps us a lot because engineer must solve problems quickly and the best way he/she can. . I wish to start a sentence Todays abstract math, tomorrows practic math. It means that we need to first bring an idea, with abstraction wheter or not possible. For example, Jules Verne when he first wrote to \"Ay\\'a Yolculuk\" he seen to other people as crazy or abstract, but his dream comes true after decades. The point I\\'m trying to make here is that as engineer, we mostly cant do things that doesnt thinked, and in the process of thinking these things, abstraction is crutial. , Abstraction means solving the real life problems with using our minds. Abstraction help us the generilaze our problems and make a solution from our knowledge. With using abstraction we can make our disicinous more easier. . abstraction makes us generilze and think out of the box. we can makes theories without any information and prove the hypotesis.  Abstraction helps us solve real life problems. with mathematics and calculus We abstract the information on mechanics and apply the information to real life problems. It helps us approximate the solution better. Archimedes used this on approximating pi. , ıf. you had a problem. you should understand that in that helps you to convert it to mathematic, mathematical language. otherwise you cant abstarct things. procrastination by infinitly instant changes. cumulative informations helps ıf. you had three things square, triangle and circle. ıf. you dont abstract them. you cant solve and explain infinity problems. - , We can abstract mathemathical things from their physical bindings and make them more general so that we can use it for more problems. . Since abstraction is a process of conceptualizing things, it simplifies things and gives us a different perspective to provide a clearer approachIt turns a big problem into a smaller problem. . When we have a problem, we can abstract it so that it can become simplified, which makes us understand the problems better and come up with solutions easier. . If we know the how inside of the job works, we can do better at outside of the job tooWhen we abstrac a machine or a job we can learn about. how is it doing that thing inside of the machine? , It helps us to see the problem\\'s solutions in different waysIt also helps us to create new ideas and solutionsAnd sometimes, when calculating is limited, it helps us to think in different parallelsSo since engineering is a job that needs creativity and maybe a bit overthinkingan engineer should learn and know how to abstract something in their mind. . Of course it increased the limits of our brains and our imagination. But the real reason why abstraction helped us is not using any tools. when we are doing abstraction, You can approximately calculate the rocks in the Konyaaltı just in your mind. In this situation, thinking about something that needs math or physics is getting easier to get the results. That takes engineering abilities in our mind to different level. By that we never wait for a calculator to do something about engineering. And also it make us think hard things as a quick, easy problems. . It helps us thinking theoretically. It generalizes the idea/problem. . Abstraction provide easier way to do engineering. We can imagine and then write it by codes so that important work emerge. For instance, let us think a shop. This shop needs a programme because they cannot follow the their stocks. An computer engineer for solving this problem. imagine and can improve an application. , to solve a nature problem with math. firstly we can understand it and we can understand it in real. but we can apply this to math because in math there are many answers. so we firstly abtraction a problem and then we can applied to math this problem.  Abstraction helps us engineers with preparing algorithms to our problems. It helps us think about the problem first and how to solve it. , Abstraction is taking the problems in nature and trying to solve them with symbols. Mathematic is a perfect way to abstract a problem. In engineering we have to come up with functions to solve problems. These functions are mathematical problems. Therefore we always abstract our problems to solve them. , by making people think efficiently. for example, there is a saying \"todays abstraction math is tomorrows applied math\", which means the mathematical terms we are thinking about but cant really comprehend today, for example some kind of paradoxes or some theorems that are not proven yet, will possibly be taught at high schools in the future. So its a cumulative thing. The abstraction we do today is going to help the engineers in the future. , Engineers need to prove their. it is helping us while we are proving something. . It helps us to find solutions to specifically physical problems. Abstracting is making problems easier to solve while using logic, physics, instantaneous values and mathematics, and especially calculus. We can use abstraction, then differentiation and integral so that measurement and engineering is easier. . Abstraction in mathematics helped in a good way to engineering better. Also, the way we think and the way see today is more beyond the space and time. It helped us to make sense things we cant actually see in reality. . Abstraction helps us to understand better axioms. Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. We understand better with formulas. We need to start thinking and to do that we need to understand what we are supposed to think. . When trying to solve a problem through engineering, one can\\'t always have a solid physical sight to think or calculate something beforehand. Maths is the language of engineering and physics and helps us to think and visualize in an abstract way. that could prevent giant mistakes and accidents. . \"Todays abstract math is tomorrows engineering math. Abstraction helps us to use unkown things\". . That makes easier to predict the next step and think about a problem and its solution. . We can abstract some physical things to Mathematical or other Scientific models with abstraction So it can help us to understand and make better industrial or daily things. We can do engineering better thanks to abstraction. - Helps engineers foresee the problems and makes it possible to take precautions in order to solve the problem before it happens.  When we abstract something before we work on it, it is more easy to get over this problem and cheaper and time-saver because we first use imagination. so the problem can be more solvable and our approach to problem become more fast. , They can think correctly of calculations. Abstraction provided the abstract math become the applied math which we use todayin modern system. Also there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\' applied math\\'\\'. Also, algebra is big effect in the engineering. Al kwharizmi is the father of algebra. , We can imagine the problem in our head by abstraction. For example, we can take an easy real-life problem and transfer it to in our head. By that way problem will get easier. This will make think and discuss better. We can do abstract solving.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":53}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install language-tool-python"],"metadata":{"id":"i5Dmb0TG2Wtn"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6-) GRAMMAR CORRECTION"],"metadata":{"id":"bTknchCD6BWe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import language_tool_python\n","tool = language_tool_python.LanguageTool('en-US')"],"metadata":{"id":"zM0p4nDl3mFY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text = tool.correct(text)"],"metadata":{"id":"3QcOjcym3mH4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":123},"id":"7RCbI8tc3mKG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669750366890,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Mert Bayraktar","userId":"05383922882662101824"}},"outputId":"f177016b-141a-47da-a2a1-926d1617a9b2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["' Abstraction is generalizing concepts. Engineers can use this for calculating abstract things. This helps for engineers to solving abstract problems. Abstraction is useful for think easily.  \"Invested Zero and then invested number. First binary system. Then we calculate some science and math problems with this invested \".  There is a famous line today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied, Which means that we developed math and better way to express things with abstract math.  Abstraction is one of the greatest tool of the engineer. By abstracting a problem we can solve little pieces of a bigger problem and connect all the at the end.  \"Before, abstract Math is today\\'s proven science\". Some ideas can be abstract now. However, it might be proven by other scientists in the future. So it is important to get a development.  With abstraction, we can understand things that difficult to understand. Approximation law by infinity, instant change, abstract predict interest, approximation, senate tragedy, democracy. - \"Zero is representative abstraction. Thus calculating and engineering are better \".  \"Nothingness or having nothing. It gives rise. The ability for a common person to be able to do mathematics isn’t. Before it, mathematicians struggled to perform the simplest arithmetic calculations. Zero helps generalize nothingness\".  It helps us to make calculations calculating more easily. It helps us to generalize things. For instance, before the invention of, they just use nothing. Invention of zero helps to generalize and representing nothingness. We observe nature and convert it to theory information.  \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. Everything is easier with abstract math. \".  With abstraction, you can understand examples and problem time in engineering process. Thorugh abstraction when you solved problem, so you will be able to translate problem which solved from one branch of engineering into another. So you will gain time and money because you won\\'t spend money and time to solve them again.  \"Abstraction is important because algorithm Engineers can see something, but they don\\'t understand something. What can they understand? Send to some object they can easily use to understand and predict\". -, \"because abstraction helps us to think that we will do before doing it. It shows us what we do actually but not completed. It decreases the cost of product\".  \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Old people know to \"\"How can we add something from past\"\" and they are perfect searcher. Because of that. Their engineering was good Egypt, Greeks, Rome\".  To solve any problem in life, first you have to abstract it to the formal math language. And also abstraction helps us to put things in groups, natural numbersfull numbers. Those all are kind an abstraction. Even one of the most significant invention of math, the zero, is the most important abstraction example in math. It helped us to create based system. With that way we could define huge quantities and got many, many benefits.  Abstraction help us when we need to calculate math, physics problem without abstraction. We cannot do this thing. For example, if we calculate diameter, a radius or something like that we need abstactionand this thing help us engineer to creative things, for example coding and thinking about coding, deep thinking, all of this thing s abstraction. ,, For example, zero. Zero actually meanings nothing. It is abstract math But with zero you can do many calculations for engineering easily. On the other, and we used abstraction to solve some physical problems, We abstract the physical problem and solve them with using some mathematical methods. It is quite important for engineering. We can solve some problems better with abstraction. It is really important for the engineering.  \"Solving problems easily with abstraction. Engineering handles the problems if problems selected one by one. What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Government? What is the role of the theater in the Ancient Greece and Rome. How does abstraction help us do engineering better? What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth\".  Abstraction is generalizing complex things. Abstract math helps us to understand engineering better. For example, and (binary digits) makes easy to understand computer And people developed new computer language using abstraction And we can understand computer easier.  Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. I mean color of shoe has no meaning for computer unless we teach it via usage of abstraction technique. For example, invention of zero is also type of abstraction (that is comes from Indian religion \"Nirvana\"). Anything you see in the real world can be represented on computer. Via using Abstraction We can represent their functions and ability. Being represented of something allows us to get everything from real world via abstraction. For example, let\\'s assume you have a car In computer science you can represent it with usage of classes. Also you can create example of that class. Class can have field and functions of it represent thing.  Its help to imagine.  Abstraction is helping us for be good engineerThanks to abstraction we can use thinking more analytical again thanks to abstraction we can use zero in our current counting systemBecause abstraction is helping us to think about nothingness and existence. . \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? It makes simple, do that It help us the solutions for questions. Abstraction is a thinking freely \". . With using abstraction we can shorten the average time we\\'re going to spend on a work. Its simply more efficient. . \" How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Roma\\'s civilization engineering for military.

If there is a problem, and we have to solve it, we should abstract it in our mind. So this helps us to solve this problem easily. An engineer is always going to face many of problems and wants to solve them Because it is his job To make easy the solutions. Abstraction is very helpful selection, For instance, a civil engineer might face to a problem when construct a build. If he/she use abstraction - he thinks the problem in his/her mind as abstract - the problem will be easier to solve. . For example, in real world the thinks aren\\'t perfectly shaped, But in geometry we can assume that there are perfect shapes and can do calculations on them.  Abstraction is important because people use that to improve science. People improved the science, engineering would be better.  Abstraction helps us do engineering better. Zero limit, infinity. We know something there, but we do not know how much. Approximation, science, inconsistency, arbitraryInconsistency between themInduction of ideas Rome, Ancient GreeceFunction \"abstraction helps us think better of problem and find the best solution way engineering better. \". . It provides us thinking more efficient, and then we do engineering better.  Abstraction helps us do engineering betterBecause abstraction is important at the theaterExample Romans theater and Greeks theater is different Greek\\'s theater platform is circle of them helps us do engineering better. . \"The formal language to computers is binary, which is passing on zeros and ones, and zero is an abstraction \". ,, \"We can calculate easier with abstractionToday some things easier to understand. With abstraction. We can easily imagine some thingsAbstraction make easier the engineering. \". . In early ages there were very little amounts of knowledge and engineering systems, so abstraction helped them with creativity, solving problems, creating something. All of them could be existed with thinking abstract. . \"Zero is the most abstraction. Zero had been invented for easier calculations and abstract mathematic. For example. When ı use computer, most users unaware the inner workings in the computer. I can learn this because of abstraction \". ,, Abstraction helps to avoid time-wasting and prevents problems before they happen, because we imagine before we take action and see those problems, so we prevent those problems.  Abstraction is a thinking way. It help us find solutions to specifically or hard physical problems. You can abstract a problem basically in your mind, and you can solve this problem on your mind. After that you can solve this problem on real life because you find a way with thinking, and you know what to do.  In some problems we may not have as many as matter to solve the problems abstraction helps us to solve our problem without even having the materiality this way, now, engineering came so far. . \"\\'Today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'. We can use and calculate the equation by abstraction, and then we can use this thing in applied math and engineering like Pyramids\". . \"Some calculating needs more effort than ordinary human can. So in this reason, especially in math, people had to assume some steps that they can\\'t do in order to complete the thing that they started, For example calculating PI. Also, reality has some limit that you can\\'t surpass, but abstraction can make you feel free when you think about something. \". . Abstraction helps us solve a real world, physical problem by making it an abstract one, one that is solvable intellectually without any physical work. . They could imagine better and cleverly. . The inventions are constructed in the mind of their inventor, and we say abstraction it. Therefore, if we make a lot of abstraction about the invention or machine, we can have the best engineering devices. So engineering developing thanks to abstraction. . We describe to hard thing and it will be easy for us. . We can say abstraction is symbol of nothingnessSometimes we can not explain everything with mathematical symbols, so abstraction help us about thisAbstraction is also generalization, and it is important to engineering. . Abstraction provides us more exact conclusions on our calculations and studies in the branches of science. It helps us deeply and more effective work while we\\'re working on problems. . It helps us solve our problems in our head without actually doing some difficult experiments, And It also helps us understand some theories that are not suitable for modeling in real world, such as binary system or transistors that says is on and is off, which is related to electric currency. . We do not take the data we do not need to throw them away, so we can focus on data we need clearly. . Today we abstract our ideas and tomorrow we can execute our ideas for real in engineering, because if we want the make something happens, we need to think what to do, We need to imagine and after that we can do things that we imagined. . For example, we had started thinking better, so we did smart works. . With an Abstraction it possible to explain experiments or research that couldn\\'t observe the results. The in physical life It makes our job easierWith using this method used to understand and predict. Bring more rational answer to us progressive and cumulative science improved with that way.  Existing in thought or an idea but not have a physical form could calculate the area of house by thinking abstraction example thinking the area of house as a square. . There is a saying \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\". As we understand from this quote, abstraction is the step right before the real application. In order to invent new devices, technologies, etc. we should take the abstract and apply it by using sciences such as physics and math. Calculus is also related. Isaac Newton did studies on abstract math and couldn\\'t apply all of them into reality, but today many works of engineering is based on Newton\\'s studies. . With abstraction, humanity can build building more easy and stronger. . We found zero with abstraction, and we can describe it with use abstraction. Then we solved a lot of problems with use zero. Also, we can find answer to difficult questions. We can solve the measly. . Abstraction is very important for us because we need to understand how to solve a problem. Especially math and physics can do it. So if we learn them we can be better, engineer better. . It helps us make problem to things that we can solve, For instance calculating the size of pyramids. We abstract the problem into the mind so that we can figure it out how we can do.  It helps us think more creatively. Thus we can make complicated problems to simply ones. Then we solve the problems easily or we understand nature.  We are using this predicts and abstract some ideas for prove for example we want to make new, invent or work firstly we abstract that matter and then we apply.  Abstraction is an obligation because we know a lot of theorems, rules and calculations, but all of them are general. But when we have a real problem we should transform the base problem into a case (rule, theorem or equation) and we always use abstraction to do this. Abstraction is transforming the problem unsolvable to solvable. So if we focus on this basics, abstraction can help us better.  Abstraction turns a problem to mathematically form, and we can use calculus.  We imagine and generalize problems in our mind. Then we solve it in our minister we understand the problem and solution after that we will be able to find a strict solution or proven function.  \"There is a saying \"\"today\\'s abstract mathematic is future\\'s applied mathematic\"\", so every abstract idea can be applied and useful abstraction is necessary for engineering\".  Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. The thing what I am trying to say is color of a car has no meaning for computer unless we teach it with right abstraction technique. , For example, in Abstraction means removal of details. Essentially you remove unnecessary details to get a clear view. Typically, you want to be able to analyze/demonstrate/prove/communicate/verify/validate a set of properties based on informed design decisions. Seeing the design in the code is like trying to perceive the forest while walking among the trees. You see cues but not the forest. Different purposes need different abstractions.  Abstraction helps to us about thinking. When we use it we can do anything as mathematically what we cannot feel in realistic world. So we can think about infinity and use it. We can also use zero in problem-solving or calculating.  It helps us to do the distinct disciplines better. For instance, people used it to laid of foundations, mathematics and engineering. Also, Before, Civilizations of Ancient Greek used abstraction and abstract mathematics to give a meaning of numbers and explain the science a bit rationallyAbstraction is a kind of bridge for the applied math and engineering and there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math, Tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'\\'. It shows us The science is cumulative and progressive.  \"We can not do every thing with applied science, but if we use abstraction we can imagine it easily. For example, zero we can not feel or touching, but we can imagine with abstraction, and we use in applied engineering qualitative to quantitative\". . We use math for abstraction nature. So we always look at the nature for making a new product.  Abstraction helps us to do engineering better. Objects are real and creating shapes from objects helps engineering to think better. Shaping thinking, creating multiple universes, more dimensions. ,, If- we didn\\'t use abstraction. Many things can not understandable for calculations. For example, when Greeks found PI, abstraction helped to find this number It also helped for creating mathematical philosophy like quantum mathematics or etc. it helps us think more creatively, that we can make problems completely in easier way. When we do abstraction the problem can be more clearly, and we can find a solution to solve it fast.  \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrows applied math. For less effort we used abstraction. We can guess something, for example distance between Earth and Moon. Approximation helped us. Instant of change and Calculus\". . Abstraction helps engineer to think more openly, and it makes us generalize the things that we thought. There are things in World that can be representative. By abstraction It makes easier to think and solve the problems sought to those problems. If we don\\'t teach the computer what it should know, we can\\'t make it work. For example, we should teach computer that what color or shine is? . Abstraction helps us in many ways in science, Not only engineering. Also, we use abstraction in math and mathematical expressions. We calculate very big numbers, distances. Science is abstract description, mathematics using nature. . \"Abstraction help us about thinking and solving problems. In the other hand, abstraction helps us convert abstraction math to applied math. So abstraction makes us strong against problems. It contributed creating new technologies and fields\". . \"It helps to imagine problems as models and helps to find logical solutions for real life problems And also it helps to think theoretically and obtain new formulas and relations\". . Abstraction provide us more exact conclusions. Like Abstraction help us to eliminate wrong results and trying to reach perfect result. . Observing nature and finding some problems are fundamental steps of the science. Every day we solve a lot of problems. Engineers also must solve these problems. Abstraction helps us do engineering better because in daily life we observe the nature, find the problem and abstract the things. When we find problem we should think about how can we solve it. That moment we need to abstract it, Predict what kind of problem is, and our approach should be correct. Today we abstract some problems, tomorrow problems will be applied. -. We can\\'t explain our theories or plans without abstraction example, we all know the fact that if you throw a ball to air, it fallout we can\\'t explain the mathematical truth of this event explain it we use abstraction In engineering it\\'s similar, because if you want to invent something first you have to plan and calculate things. For those you must use numbers at least. And as we know, the numbers are abstraction. We use it everywhere in engineeringAlso the future engineers can look back and inspire from them, so they will be able to invent better things. . Abstraction helps us about functioning the function in our mind, and it is important to engineer because today s abstract thinking, tomorrow s reality. . \"It makes us abstract issue of real life in your head by math \". . Abstraction help us to predict of the problem, Observe the nature and find the. With abstraction of the problem And solution of abstraction we\\'re trying to fins rational answer for problem. Also, abstraction made of Mathematics. . Abstraction is a method which we can think no existing object or content. Because of this We can plane building a stricter without actually build. Thanks to abstraction. . Abstraction is an indispensable tool in the engineering process. Engineers can improve their ability to relate physically distinct conceptsAbstracting concrete events.  Abstraction removes the connections to real world and make them generic so that we can think processes and make operations simply. Important theorems and rules, generally based on abstract math. Today\\'s abstract mats is tomorrows applied math. So we are using rules, information and theorems which discovered by abstraction years ago, and it helps us for better engineering. -, because we learned how to better with limes and this make us think about it. -. They practice agriculture and they\\'re calculating abstract things.  Helps us to think more efficiently and more creatively and helps us to solve the problems by different ways and testing methods to solve problems. . Zero is the most important abstraction. Defining something that does not exist always was one of the biggest question marks in people\\'s mind, even back in Ancient Greece. However, now we know that in binary, in computers\\' life language, zero is one of the most important aspects. Things exist, and they don\\'t binary and, in its essence, zero. lets us define those that do not exist Whenever we code something that has no value, something that has no name.  Is one of the most used defining methods in engineering. Zero volt energy means we don\\'t have any electric. If we have zero amount of a material, that building can\\'t use that material. In essence, engineering is having one thing and not having the other one. Zero is the name we give to those we do not have.  \"Abstraction helps to us, like thinking about the zero\"\"\"\"Because zero is nothing, but we can think about zero. It is not just that We should think about. Bathmat is meanless if we can not think about like in integer and limit, you should think infinity and approaching to infinityThere is a lot of examples. Today\\'s abstraction is tomorrow\\'s applied Math \".  If there is a problem, we can take it into an abstraction form and solve it with using mathematics formulas. It helps us to think about a solution.  It is really important because we need to start from thinking, And abstraction help us to see what is our plan and what are we going to do. Furthermore, it gives us a logic and ideas. There is a saying which is \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrows applied math. \" For example, if we are planning to make mobile app, first we need to make abstraction, which is defined what we are going to use for technology. Or it is also same with classes. In programming to, we are doing abstraction. For example, we have users, so we need to define usernames and surnames, and it is the abstraction, It is like blueprinting.  Abstraction is turning real life problems into the ones that we can solve on our minds. That includes turning them into a mathematical one as well. So abstraction helps us do engineering better, because we can actually do calculations if we abstract real life problems into the ones that we can solve.  We can apply math in something we can face in daily life. We can abstract a problem in to smaller pieces and its easier the solve and we can apply math to this problem. , it is modelling the structures and that helps to engineer. Engineer solves problems and thinks better with abstraction.  \"Abstraction is making together things to get them understand easily. It\\'s like you have something smaller, and you put a few of them together, and you get a bigger thing, and you use the bigger thing for your next project instead of using small thing again and again. For example, you have a function in a program, you just call it when you need it. You\\'re not typing the commands that inside the that function again and again. So in that way engineering, math, physic became more understandable and easy to use, and they put real life problems into math. That is abstraction\".  Today\\'s abstract math. Tomorrows applied Mathis the early parts of project. If engineer thinks abstractly, next moves can be easy and engineer can make next steps easier. Abstract thinking is predicting. . We can think things better with abstraction, for example on mathematics. If we use abstraction, we can applied it in programs robots etc., It helps us to think and be creative helps us find solutions to the problems we can\\'t solve by simply testing, such as infinite problems. , We can easily understand the problems with abstraction because its help us to imagine the problem in our Minuit. Helps us a lot because engineer must solve problems quickly and the best way he/she can. . I wish to start a sentence Today\\'s abstract math, tomorrow\\'s practice math. It means that we need to first bring an idea, with abstraction whether or not possible. For example, Jules Verne when he first wrote to \"A\\'a Calculus\" he has seen to other people as crazy or abstract, but his dream comes true after decades. The point I\\'m trying to make here is that as engineer, we mostly can\\'t do things that doesn\\'t thought, and in the process of thinking these things, abstraction is crucial. , Abstraction means solving the real life problems with using our minds. Abstraction help us the generalize our problems and make a solution from our knowledge. With using abstraction we can make our delicious easier. . Abstraction makes us generalize and think out of the box. We can make theories without any information and prove the hypothesis.  Abstraction helps us solve real life problems. With mathematics and calculus We abstract the information on mechanics and apply the information to real life problems. It helps us approximate the solution better. Archimedes used this on approximating pi. , IF. you had a problem. You should understand that in that helps you to convert it to mathematic, mathematical language. Otherwise you can\\'t abstract things. Procrastination by infinity instant changes. Cumulative information help IF. you had three things square, triangle and circle. If. you don\\'t abstract them. You can\\'t solve and explain infinity problems. -, We can abstract mathematical things from their physical bindings and make them more general so that we can use it for more problems. . Since abstraction is a process of conceptualizing things, it simplifies things and gives us a different perspective to provide a clearer approach It turns a big problem into a smaller problem. . When we have a problem, we can abstract it so that it can become simplified, which makes us understand the problems better and come up with solutions easier. . If we know how inside the job works, we can do better at outside the job toothed we abstract a machine or a job we can learn about. How is it doing that thing inside the machine? , It helps us to see the problem\\'s solutions in different ways It also helps us to create new ideas and solutions sometimes, when calculating is limited, it helps us to think in different parallels since engineering is a job that needs creativity and maybe a bit overthinking an engineer should learn and know how to abstract something in their mind. . Of course, it increased the limits of our brains and our imagination. But the real reason why abstraction helped us is not using any tools. When we are doing abstraction, You can approximately calculate the rocks in the Konyaaltı just in your mind. In this situation, thinking about something that needs math or physics is getting easier to get the results. That takes engineering abilities in our mind to different level. By that we never wait for a calculator to do something about engineering. And also it makes us think hard things as a quick, easy problems. . It helps us to think theoretically. It generalizes the idea/problem. . Abstraction provide easier way to do engineering. We can imagine and then write it by codes so that important work emerge. For instance, let us think a shop. This shop needs a program because they cannot follow the stocks. A computer engineer for solving this problem. Imagine and can improve an application. , to solve a nature problem with math. Firstly we can understand it, and we can understand it in real. But we can apply this to math because in math there are many answers. So we firstly attraction a problem, and then we can apply to math this problem.  Abstraction helps us engineers with preparing algorithms to our problems. It helps us think about the problem first and how to solve it. , Abstraction is taking the problems in nature and trying to solve them with symbols. Mathematic is a perfect way to abstract a problem. In engineering we have to come up with functions to solve problems. These functions are mathematical problems. Therefore, we always abstract our problems to solve them. , by making people think efficiently. For example, there is a saying \"today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrows applied math\", which means the mathematical terms we are thinking about but can\\'t really comprehend today, for example some kind of paradoxes or some theorems that are not proven yet, will possibly be taught at high schools in the future. So it\\'s a cumulative thing. The abstraction we do today is going to help the engineers in the future. , Engineers need to prove their. It is helping us while we are proving something. . It helps us find solutions to specifically physical problems. Abstracting is making problems easier to solve while using logic, physics, instantaneous values and mathematics, and especially calculus. We can use abstraction, then differentiation and integral so that measurement and engineering is easier. . Abstraction in mathematics helped in a good way to engineering better. Also, the way we think, and the way see today is more beyond the space and time. It helped us to make sense things we can\\'t actually see in reality. . Abstraction helps us to understand better axioms. Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. We understand better with formulas. We need to start thinking and to do that we need to understand what we are supposed to think. . When trying to solve a problem through engineering, one can\\'t always have a solid physical sight to think or calculate something beforehand. Math is the language of engineering and physics and helps us to think and visualize in an abstract way. That could prevent giant mistakes and accidents. . \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s engineering math. Abstraction helps us to use unknown things\". . That makes easier to predict the next step and think about a problem and its solution. . We can abstract some physical things to Mathematical or other Scientific models with abstraction So it can help us to understand and make better industrial or daily things. We can do engineering better thanks to abstraction. - Helps engineers foresee the problems and makes it possible to take precautions in order to solve the problem before it happens.  When we abstract something before we work on it, it is easier to get over this problem and cheaper and time-saver because we first use imagination. So the problem can be more solvable and our approach to problem become more fast. , They can think correctly of calculations. Abstraction provided the abstract math become the applied math which we use today in modern system. Also, there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\' applied math\\'\\'. Besides, algebra is big effect in the engineering. Al Khwarizmi is the father of algebra. , We can imagine the problem in our head by abstraction. For example, we can take an easy real-life problem and transfer it to in our head. By that way problem will get easier. This will make think and discuss better. We can do abstract solving.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":40}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with open(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/NLP_PROJECT/QAs-3.txt\",'w+') as my_file:\n","  my_file.write(text)"],"metadata":{"id":"1H5KMAED3mMg"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text = text.replace(\" . \",\" \")\n","text"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":123},"id":"9oiUfMVv3mPV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669751163896,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":311,"user":{"displayName":"Mert Bayraktar","userId":"05383922882662101824"}},"outputId":"5b61f76c-ac73-4e5a-f517-bcdaadec43a4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["' Abstraction is generalizing concepts. Engineers can use this for calculating abstract things. This helps for engineers to solving abstract problems. Abstraction is useful for think easily.  \"Invested Zero and then invested number. First binary system. Then we calculate some science and math problems with this invested \".  There is a famous line today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied, Which means that we developed math and better way to express things with abstract math.  Abstraction is one of the greatest tool of the engineer. By abstracting a problem we can solve little pieces of a bigger problem and connect all the at the end.  \"Before, abstract Math is today\\'s proven science\". Some ideas can be abstract now. However, it might be proven by other scientists in the future. So it is important to get a development.  With abstraction, we can understand things that difficult to understand. Approximation law by infinity, instant change, abstract predict interest, approximation, senate tragedy, democracy. - \"Zero is representative abstraction. Thus calculating and engineering are better \".  \"Nothingness or having nothing. It gives rise. The ability for a common person to be able to do mathematics isn’t. Before it, mathematicians struggled to perform the simplest arithmetic calculations. Zero helps generalize nothingness\".  It helps us to make calculations calculating more easily. It helps us to generalize things. For instance, before the invention of, they just use nothing. Invention of zero helps to generalize and representing nothingness. We observe nature and convert it to theory information.  \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. Everything is easier with abstract math. \".  With abstraction, you can understand examples and problem time in engineering process. Thorugh abstraction when you solved problem, so you will be able to translate problem which solved from one branch of engineering into another. So you will gain time and money because you won\\'t spend money and time to solve them again.  \"Abstraction is important because algorithm Engineers can see something, but they don\\'t understand something. What can they understand? Send to some object they can easily use to understand and predict\". -, \"because abstraction helps us to think that we will do before doing it. It shows us what we do actually but not completed. It decreases the cost of product\".  \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Old people know to \"\"How can we add something from past\"\" and they are perfect searcher. Because of that. Their engineering was good Egypt, Greeks, Rome\".  To solve any problem in life, first you have to abstract it to the formal math language. And also abstraction helps us to put things in groups, natural numbersfull numbers. Those all are kind an abstraction. Even one of the most significant invention of math, the zero, is the most important abstraction example in math. It helped us to create based system. With that way we could define huge quantities and got many, many benefits.  Abstraction help us when we need to calculate math, physics problem without abstraction. We cannot do this thing. For example, if we calculate diameter, a radius or something like that we need abstactionand this thing help us engineer to creative things, for example coding and thinking about coding, deep thinking, all of this thing s abstraction. ,, For example, zero. Zero actually meanings nothing. It is abstract math But with zero you can do many calculations for engineering easily. On the other, and we used abstraction to solve some physical problems, We abstract the physical problem and solve them with using some mathematical methods. It is quite important for engineering. We can solve some problems better with abstraction. It is really important for the engineering.  \"Solving problems easily with abstraction. Engineering handles the problems if problems selected one by one. What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Government? What is the role of the theater in the Ancient Greece and Rome. How does abstraction help us do engineering better? What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth\".  Abstraction is generalizing complex things. Abstract math helps us to understand engineering better. For example, and (binary digits) makes easy to understand computer And people developed new computer language using abstraction And we can understand computer easier.

If there is a problem, and we have to solve it, we should abstract it in our mind. So this helps us to solve this problem easily. An engineer is always going to face many of problems and wants to solve them Because it is his job To make easy the solutions. Abstraction is very helpful selection, For instance, a civil engineer might face to a problem when construct a build. If he/she use abstraction - he thinks the problem in his/her mind as abstract - the problem will be easier to solve. For example, in real world the thinks aren\\'t perfectly shaped, But in geometry we can assume that there are perfect shapes and can do calculations on them.  Abstraction is important because people use that to improve science. People improved the science, engineering would be better.  Abstraction helps us do engineering better. Zero limit, infinity. We know something there, but we do not know how much. Approximation, science, inconsistency, arbitraryInconsistency between themInduction of ideas Rome, Ancient GreeceFunction \"abstraction helps us think better of problem and find the best solution way engineering better. \". It provides us thinking more efficient, and then we do engineering better.  Abstraction helps us do engineering betterBecause abstraction is important at the theaterExample Romans theater and Greeks theater is different Greek\\'s theater platform is circle of them helps us do engineering better. \"The formal language to computers is binary, which is passing on zeros and ones, and zero is an abstraction \". ,, \"We can calculate easier with abstractionToday some things easier to understand. With abstraction. We can easily imagine some thingsAbstraction make easier the engineering. \". In early ages there were very little amounts of knowledge and engineering systems, so abstraction helped them with creativity, solving problems, creating something. All of them could be existed with thinking abstract. \"Zero is the most abstraction. Zero had been invented for easier calculations and abstract mathematic. For example. When ı use computer, most users unaware the inner workings in the computer. I can learn this because of abstraction \". ,, Abstraction helps to avoid time-wasting and prevents problems before they happen, because we imagine before we take action and see those problems, so we prevent those problems.  Abstraction is a thinking way. It help us find solutions to specifically or hard physical problems. You can abstract a problem basically in your mind, and you can solve this problem on your mind. After that you can solve this problem on real life because you find a way with thinking, and you know what to do.  In some problems we may not have as many as matter to solve the problems abstraction helps us to solve our problem without even having the materiality this way, now, engineering came so far. \"\\'Today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'. We can use and calculate the equation by abstraction, and then we can use this thing in applied math and engineering like Pyramids\". \"Some calculating needs more effort than ordinary human can. So in this reason, especially in math, people had to assume some steps that they can\\'t do in order to complete the thing that they started, For example calculating PI. Also, reality has some limit that you can\\'t surpass, but abstraction can make you feel free when you think about something. \". Abstraction helps us solve a real world, physical problem by making it an abstract one, one that is solvable intellectually without any physical work. They could imagine better and cleverly. The inventions are constructed in the mind of their inventor, and we say abstraction it. Therefore, if we make a lot of abstraction about the invention or machine, we can have the best engineering devices. So engineering developing thanks to abstraction. We describe to hard thing and it will be easy for us. We can say abstraction is symbol of nothingnessSometimes we can not explain everything with mathematical symbols, so abstraction help us about thisAbstraction is also generalization, and it is important to engineering. Abstraction provides us more exact conclusions on our calculations and studies in the branches of science. It helps us deeply and more effective work while we\\'re working on problems. It helps us solve our problems in our head without actually doing some difficult experiments, And It also helps us understand some theories that are not suitable for modeling in real world, such as binary system or transistors that says is on and is off, which is related to electric currency. We do not take the data we do not need to throw them away, so we can focus on data we need clearly. Today we abstract our ideas and tomorrow we can execute our ideas for real in engineering, because if we want the make something happens, we need to think what to do, We need to imagine and after that we can do things that we imagined. For example, we had started thinking better, so we did smart works. With an Abstraction it possible to explain experiments or research that couldn\\'t observe the results. The in physical life It makes our job easierWith using this method used to understand and predict. Bring more rational answer to us progressive and cumulative science improved with that way.  Existing in thought or an idea but not have a physical form could calculate the area of house by thinking abstraction example thinking the area of house as a square. There is a saying \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\". As we understand from this quote, abstraction is the step right before the real application. In order to invent new devices, technologies, etc. we should take the abstract and apply it by using sciences such as physics and math. Calculus is also related. Isaac Newton did studies on abstract math and couldn\\'t apply all of them into reality, but today many works of engineering is based on Newton\\'s studies. With abstraction, humanity can build building more easy and stronger. We found zero with abstraction, and we can describe it with use abstraction. Then we solved a lot of problems with use zero. Also, we can find answer to difficult questions. We can solve the measly. Abstraction is very important for us because we need to understand how to solve a problem. Especially math and physics can do it. So if we learn them we can be better, engineer better. It helps us make problem to things that we can solve, For instance calculating the size of pyramids. We abstract the problem into the mind so that we can figure it out how we can do.  It helps us think more creatively. Thus we can make complicated problems to simply ones. Then we solve the problems easily or we understand nature.  We are using this predicts and abstract some ideas for prove for example we want to make new, invent or work firstly we abstract that matter and then we apply.  Abstraction is an obligation because we know a lot of theorems, rules and calculations, but all of them are general. But when we have a real problem we should transform the base problem into a case (rule, theorem or equation) and we always use abstraction to do this. Abstraction is transforming the problem unsolvable to solvable. So if we focus on this basics, abstraction can help us better.  Abstraction turns a problem to mathematically form, and we can use calculus.  We imagine and generalize problems in our mind. Then we solve it in our minister we understand the problem and solution after that we will be able to find a strict solution or proven function.  \"There is a saying \"\"today\\'s abstract mathematic is future\\'s applied mathematic\"\", so every abstract idea can be applied and useful abstraction is necessary for engineering\".  Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. The thing what I am trying to say is color of a car has no meaning for computer unless we teach it with right abstraction technique. , For example, in Abstraction means removal of details. Essentially you remove unnecessary details to get a clear view. Typically, you want to be able to analyze/demonstrate/prove/communicate/verify/validate a set of properties based on informed design decisions. Seeing the design in the code is like trying to perceive the forest while walking among the trees. You see cues but not the forest. Different purposes need different abstractions.  Abstraction helps to us about thinking. When we use it we can do anything as mathematically what we cannot feel in realistic world. So we can think about infinity and use it. We can also use zero in problem-solving or calculating.  It helps us to do the distinct disciplines better. For instance, people used it to laid of foundations, mathematics and engineering. Also, Before, Civilizations of Ancient Greek used abstraction and abstract mathematics to give a meaning of numbers and explain the science a bit rationallyAbstraction is a kind of bridge for the applied math and engineering and there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math, Tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'\\'. It shows us The science is cumulative and progressive.  \"We can not do every thing with applied science, but if we use abstraction we can imagine it easily. For example, zero we can not feel or touching, but we can imagine with abstraction, and we use in applied engineering qualitative to quantitative\". We use math for abstraction nature. So we always look at the nature for making a new product.  Abstraction helps us to do engineering better. Objects are real and creating shapes from objects helps engineering to think better. Shaping thinking, creating multiple universes, more dimensions. ,, If- we didn\\'t use abstraction. Many things can not understandable for calculations. For example, when Greeks found PI, abstraction helped to find this number It also helped for creating mathematical philosophy like quantum mathematics or etc. it helps us think more creatively, that we can make problems completely in easier way. When we do abstraction the problem can be more clearly, and we can find a solution to solve it fast.  \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrows applied math. For less effort we used abstraction. We can guess something, for example distance between Earth and Moon. Approximation helped us. Instant of change and Calculus\". Abstraction helps engineer to think more openly, and it makes us generalize the things that we thought. There are things in World that can be representative. By abstraction It makes easier to think and solve the problems sought to those problems. If we don\\'t teach the computer what it should know, we can\\'t make it work. For example, we should teach computer that what color or shine is? Abstraction helps us in many ways in science, Not only engineering. Also, we use abstraction in math and mathematical expressions. We calculate very big numbers, distances. Science is abstract description, mathematics using nature. \"Abstraction help us about thinking and solving problems. In the other hand, abstraction helps us convert abstraction math to applied math. So abstraction makes us strong against problems. It contributed creating new technologies and fields\". \"It helps to imagine problems as models and helps to find logical solutions for real life problems And also it helps to think theoretically and obtain new formulas and relations\". Abstraction provide us more exact conclusions. Like Abstraction help us to eliminate wrong results and trying to reach perfect result. Observing nature and finding some problems are fundamental steps of the science. Every day we solve a lot of problems. Engineers also must solve these problems. Abstraction helps us do engineering better because in daily life we observe the nature, find the problem and abstract the things. When we find problem we should think about how can we solve it. That moment we need to abstract it, Predict what kind of problem is, and our approach should be correct. Today we abstract some problems, tomorrow problems will be applied. -. We can\\'t explain our theories or plans without abstraction example, we all know the fact that if you throw a ball to air, it fallout we can\\'t explain the mathematical truth of this event explain it we use abstraction In engineering it\\'s similar, because if you want to invent something first you have to plan and calculate things. For those you must use numbers at least. And as we know, the numbers are abstraction. We use it everywhere in engineeringAlso the future engineers can look back and inspire from them, so they will be able to invent better things. Abstraction helps us about functioning the function in our mind, and it is important to engineer because today s abstract thinking, tomorrow s reality. \"It makes us abstract issue of real life in your head by math \". Abstraction help us to predict of the problem, Observe the nature and find the. With abstraction of the problem And solution of abstraction we\\'re trying to fins rational answer for problem. Also, abstraction made of Mathematics. Abstraction is a method which we can think no existing object or content. Because of this We can plane building a stricter without actually build. Thanks to abstraction. Abstraction is an indispensable tool in the engineering process. Engineers can improve their ability to relate physically distinct conceptsAbstracting concrete events.  Abstraction removes the connections to real world and make them generic so that we can think processes and make operations simply. Important theorems and rules, generally based on abstract math. Today\\'s abstract mats is tomorrows applied math. So we are using rules, information and theorems which discovered by abstraction years ago, and it helps us for better engineering. -, because we learned how to better with limes and this make us think about it. -. They practice agriculture and they\\'re calculating abstract things.  Helps us to think more efficiently and more creatively and helps us to solve the problems by different ways and testing methods to solve problems. Zero is the most important abstraction. Defining something that does not exist always was one of the biggest question marks in people\\'s mind, even back in Ancient Greece. However, now we know that in binary, in computers\\' life language, zero is one of the most important aspects. Things exist, and they don\\'t binary and, in its essence, zero. lets us define those that do not exist Whenever we code something that has no value, something that has no name.  Is one of the most used defining methods in engineering. Zero volt energy means we don\\'t have any electric. If we have zero amount of a material, that building can\\'t use that material. In essence, engineering is having one thing and not having the other one. Zero is the name we give to those we do not have.  \"Abstraction helps to us, like thinking about the zero\"\"\"\"Because zero is nothing, but we can think about zero. It is not just that We should think about. Bathmat is meanless if we can not think about like in integer and limit, you should think infinity and approaching to infinityThere is a lot of examples. Today\\'s abstraction is tomorrow\\'s applied Math \".  If there is a problem, we can take it into an abstraction form and solve it with using mathematics formulas. It helps us to think about a solution.  It is really important because we need to start from thinking, And abstraction help us to see what is our plan and what are we going to do. Furthermore, it gives us a logic and ideas. There is a saying which is \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrows applied math. \" For example, if we are planning to make mobile app, first we need to make abstraction, which is defined what we are going to use for technology. Or it is also same with classes. In programming to, we are doing abstraction. For example, we have users, so we need to define usernames and surnames, and it is the abstraction, It is like blueprinting.  Abstraction is turning real life problems into the ones that we can solve on our minds. That includes turning them into a mathematical one as well. So abstraction helps us do engineering better, because we can actually do calculations if we abstract real life problems into the ones that we can solve.  We can apply math in something we can face in daily life. We can abstract a problem in to smaller pieces and its easier the solve and we can apply math to this problem. , it is modelling the structures and that helps to engineer. Engineer solves problems and thinks better with abstraction.  \"Abstraction is making together things to get them understand easily. It\\'s like you have something smaller, and you put a few of them together, and you get a bigger thing, and you use the bigger thing for your next project instead of using small thing again and again. For example, you have a function in a program, you just call it when you need it. You\\'re not typing the commands that inside the that function again and again. So in that way engineering, math, physic became more understandable and easy to use, and they put real life problems into math. That is abstraction\".  Today\\'s abstract math. Tomorrows applied Mathis the early parts of project. If engineer thinks abstractly, next moves can be easy and engineer can make next steps easier. Abstract thinking is predicting. We can think things better with abstraction, for example on mathematics. If we use abstraction, we can applied it in programs robots etc., It helps us to think and be creative helps us find solutions to the problems we can\\'t solve by simply testing, such as infinite problems. , We can easily understand the problems with abstraction because its help us to imagine the problem in our Minuit. Helps us a lot because engineer must solve problems quickly and the best way he/she can. I wish to start a sentence Today\\'s abstract math, tomorrow\\'s practice math. It means that we need to first bring an idea, with abstraction whether or not possible. For example, Jules Verne when he first wrote to \"A\\'a Calculus\" he has seen to other people as crazy or abstract, but his dream comes true after decades. The point I\\'m trying to make here is that as engineer, we mostly can\\'t do things that doesn\\'t thought, and in the process of thinking these things, abstraction is crucial. , Abstraction means solving the real life problems with using our minds. Abstraction help us the generalize our problems and make a solution from our knowledge. With using abstraction we can make our delicious easier. Abstraction makes us generalize and think out of the box. We can make theories without any information and prove the hypothesis.  Abstraction helps us solve real life problems. With mathematics and calculus We abstract the information on mechanics and apply the information to real life problems. It helps us approximate the solution better. Archimedes used this on approximating pi. , IF. you had a problem. You should understand that in that helps you to convert it to mathematic, mathematical language. Otherwise you can\\'t abstract things. Procrastination by infinity instant changes. Cumulative information help IF. you had three things square, triangle and circle. If. you don\\'t abstract them. You can\\'t solve and explain infinity problems. -, We can abstract mathematical things from their physical bindings and make them more general so that we can use it for more problems. Since abstraction is a process of conceptualizing things, it simplifies things and gives us a different perspective to provide a clearer approach It turns a big problem into a smaller problem. When we have a problem, we can abstract it so that it can become simplified, which makes us understand the problems better and come up with solutions easier. If we know how inside the job works, we can do better at outside the job toothed we abstract a machine or a job we can learn about. How is it doing that thing inside the machine? , It helps us to see the problem\\'s solutions in different ways It also helps us to create new ideas and solutions sometimes, when calculating is limited, it helps us to think in different parallels since engineering is a job that needs creativity and maybe a bit overthinking an engineer should learn and know how to abstract something in their mind. Of course, it increased the limits of our brains and our imagination. But the real reason why abstraction helped us is not using any tools. When we are doing abstraction, You can approximately calculate the rocks in the Konyaaltı just in your mind. In this situation, thinking about something that needs math or physics is getting easier to get the results. That takes engineering abilities in our mind to different level. By that we never wait for a calculator to do something about engineering. And also it makes us think hard things as a quick, easy problems. It helps us to think theoretically. It generalizes the idea/problem. Abstraction provide easier way to do engineering. We can imagine and then write it by codes so that important work emerge. For instance, let us think a shop. This shop needs a program because they cannot follow the stocks. A computer engineer for solving this problem. Imagine and can improve an application. , to solve a nature problem with math. Firstly we can understand it, and we can understand it in real. But we can apply this to math because in math there are many answers. So we firstly attraction a problem, and then we can apply to math this problem.  Abstraction helps us engineers with preparing algorithms to our problems. It helps us think about the problem first and how to solve it. , Abstraction is taking the problems in nature and trying to solve them with symbols. Mathematic is a perfect way to abstract a problem. In engineering we have to come up with functions to solve problems. These functions are mathematical problems. Therefore, we always abstract our problems to solve them. , by making people think efficiently. For example, there is a saying \"today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrows applied math\", which means the mathematical terms we are thinking about but can\\'t really comprehend today, for example some kind of paradoxes or some theorems that are not proven yet, will possibly be taught at high schools in the future. So it\\'s a cumulative thing. The abstraction we do today is going to help the engineers in the future. , Engineers need to prove their. It is helping us while we are proving something. It helps us find solutions to specifically physical problems. Abstracting is making problems easier to solve while using logic, physics, instantaneous values and mathematics, and especially calculus. We can use abstraction, then differentiation and integral so that measurement and engineering is easier. Abstraction in mathematics helped in a good way to engineering better. Also, the way we think, and the way see today is more beyond the space and time. It helped us to make sense things we can\\'t actually see in reality. Abstraction helps us to understand better axioms. Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. We understand better with formulas. We need to start thinking and to do that we need to understand what we are supposed to think. When trying to solve a problem through engineering, one can\\'t always have a solid physical sight to think or calculate something beforehand. Math is the language of engineering and physics and helps us to think and visualize in an abstract way. That could prevent giant mistakes and accidents. \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s engineering math. Abstraction helps us to use unknown things\". That makes easier to predict the next step and think about a problem and its solution. We can abstract some physical things to Mathematical or other Scientific models with abstraction So it can help us to understand and make better industrial or daily things. We can do engineering better thanks to abstraction. - Helps engineers foresee the problems and makes it possible to take precautions in order to solve the problem before it happens.  When we abstract something before we work on it, it is easier to get over this problem and cheaper and time-saver because we first use imagination. So the problem can be more solvable and our approach to problem become more fast. , They can think correctly of calculations. Abstraction provided the abstract math become the applied math which we use today in modern system. Also, there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\' applied math\\'\\'. Besides, algebra is big effect in the engineering. Al Khwarizmi is the father of algebra. , We can imagine the problem in our head by abstraction. For example, we can take an easy real-life problem and transfer it to in our head. By that way problem will get easier. This will make think and discuss better. We can do abstract solving.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":58}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with open(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/NLP_PROJECT/QAs-3.txt\",'w+') as my_file:\n","  my_file.write(text)"],"metadata":{"id":"55m09xWUywJP"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text = text.replace(\" ,, \",\" \")\n","text"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":123},"id":"egjqv8hl7O8V","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669751267375,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":331,"user":{"displayName":"Mert Bayraktar","userId":"05383922882662101824"}},"outputId":"ac4f606b-9923-42f7-f9de-b464a245bc34"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["' Abstraction is generalizing concepts. Engineers can use this for calculating abstract things. This helps for engineers to solving abstract problems. Abstraction is useful for think easily.  \"Invested Zero and then invested number. First binary system. Then we calculate some science and math problems with this invested \".  There is a famous line today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied, Which means that we developed math and better way to express things with abstract math.  Abstraction is one of the greatest tool of the engineer. By abstracting a problem we can solve little pieces of a bigger problem and connect all the at the end.  \"Before, abstract Math is today\\'s proven science\". Some ideas can be abstract now. However, it might be proven by other scientists in the future. So it is important to get a development.  With abstraction, we can understand things that difficult to understand. Approximation law by infinity, instant change, abstract predict interest, approximation, senate tragedy, democracy. - \"Zero is representative abstraction. Thus calculating and engineering are better \".  \"Nothingness or having nothing. It gives rise. The ability for a common person to be able to do mathematics isn’t. Before it, mathematicians struggled to perform the simplest arithmetic calculations. Zero helps generalize nothingness\".  It helps us to make calculations calculating more easily. It helps us to generalize things. For instance, before the invention of, they just use nothing. Invention of zero helps to generalize and representing nothingness. We observe nature and convert it to theory information.  \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. Everything is easier with abstract math. \".  With abstraction, you can understand examples and problem time in engineering process. Thorugh abstraction when you solved problem, so you will be able to translate problem which solved from one branch of engineering into another. So you will gain time and money because you won\\'t spend money and time to solve them again.  \"Abstraction is important because algorithm Engineers can see something, but they don\\'t understand something. What can they understand? Send to some object they can easily use to understand and predict\". -, \"because abstraction helps us to think that we will do before doing it. It shows us what we do actually but not completed. It decreases the cost of product\".  \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Old people know to \"\"How can we add something from past\"\" and they are perfect searcher. Because of that. Their engineering was good Egypt, Greeks, Rome\".  To solve any problem in life, first you have to abstract it to the formal math language. And also abstraction helps us to put things in groups, natural numbersfull numbers. Those all are kind an abstraction. Even one of the most significant invention of math, the zero, is the most important abstraction example in math. It helped us to create based system. With that way we could define huge quantities and got many, many benefits.  Abstraction help us when we need to calculate math, physics problem without abstraction. We cannot do this thing. For example, if we calculate diameter, a radius or something like that we need abstactionand this thing help us engineer to creative things, for example coding and thinking about coding, deep thinking, all of this thing s abstraction. For example, zero. Zero actually meanings nothing. It is abstract math But with zero you can do many calculations for engineering easily. On the other, and we used abstraction to solve some physical problems, We abstract the physical problem and solve them with using some mathematical methods. It is quite important for engineering. We can solve some problems better with abstraction. It is really important for the engineering.  \"Solving problems easily with abstraction. Engineering handles the problems if problems selected one by one. What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Government? What is the role of the theater in the Ancient Greece and Rome. How does abstraction help us do engineering better? What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth\".  Abstraction is generalizing complex things. Abstract math helps us to understand engineering better. For example, and (binary digits) makes easy to understand computer And people developed new computer language using abstraction And we can understand computer easier.  Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. I mean color of shoe has no meaning for computer unless we teach it via usage of abstraction technique. For example, invention of zero is also type of abstraction (that is comes from Indian religion \"Nirvana\"). Anything you see in the real world can be represented on computer. Via using Abstraction We can represent their functions and ability. Being represented of something allows us to get everything from real world via abstraction. For example, let\\'s assume you have a car In computer science you can represent it with usage of classes. Also you can create example of that class. Class can have field and functions of it represent thing.  Its help to imagine.  Abstraction is helping us for be good engineerThanks to abstraction we can use thinking more analytical again thanks to abstraction we can use zero in our current counting systemBecause abstraction is helping us to think about nothingness and existence. \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? It makes simple, do that It help us the solutions for questions. Abstraction is a thinking freely \". With using abstraction we can shorten the average time we\\'re going to spend on a work. Its simply more efficient. \" How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Roma\\'s civilization engineering for military. Greeks used to math observe and explain for science Cause and effect(Aristotle). Use the math, prove, Observe nature and explain Science can find all Aristotle\\'s deductive(Tümdengelim) \". \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Improve, establish, invented observation, approximation, approximate politic, economy, infrastructure, law, people, conflict of interest, play, rule, predict abstract conclusion.

What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Government view\". If there is a problem, and we have to solve it, we should abstract it in our mind. So this helps us to solve this problem easily. An engineer is always going to face many of problems and wants to solve them Because it is his job To make easy the solutions. Abstraction is very helpful selection, For instance, a civil engineer might face to a problem when construct a build. If he/she use abstraction - he thinks the problem in his/her mind as abstract - the problem will be easier to solve. For example, in real world the thinks aren\\'t perfectly shaped, But in geometry we can assume that there are perfect shapes and can do calculations on them.  Abstraction is important because people use that to improve science. People improved the science, engineering would be better.  Abstraction helps us do engineering better. Zero limit, infinity. We know something there, but we do not know how much. Approximation, science, inconsistency, arbitraryInconsistency between themInduction of ideas Rome, Ancient GreeceFunction \"abstraction helps us think better of problem and find the best solution way engineering better. \". It provides us thinking more efficient, and then we do engineering better.  Abstraction helps us do engineering betterBecause abstraction is important at the theaterExample Romans theater and Greeks theater is different Greek\\'s theater platform is circle of them helps us do engineering better. \"The formal language to computers is binary, which is passing on zeros and ones, and zero is an abstraction \". \"We can calculate easier with abstractionToday some things easier to understand. With abstraction. We can easily imagine some thingsAbstraction make easier the engineering. \". In early ages there were very little amounts of knowledge and engineering systems, so abstraction helped them with creativity, solving problems, creating something. All of them could be existed with thinking abstract. \"Zero is the most abstraction. Zero had been invented for easier calculations and abstract mathematic. For example. When ı use computer, most users unaware the inner workings in the computer. I can learn this because of abstraction \". Abstraction helps to avoid time-wasting and prevents problems before they happen, because we imagine before we take action and see those problems, so we prevent those problems.  Abstraction is a thinking way. It help us find solutions to specifically or hard physical problems. You can abstract a problem basically in your mind, and you can solve this problem on your mind. After that you can solve this problem on real life because you find a way with thinking, and you know what to do.  In some problems we may not have as many as matter to solve the problems abstraction helps us to solve our problem without even having the materiality this way, now, engineering came so far. \"\\'Today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'. We can use and calculate the equation by abstraction, and then we can use this thing in applied math and engineering like Pyramids\". \"Some calculating needs more effort than ordinary human can. So in this reason, especially in math, people had to assume some steps that they can\\'t do in order to complete the thing that they started, For example calculating PI. Also, reality has some limit that you can\\'t surpass, but abstraction can make you feel free when you think about something. \". Abstraction helps us solve a real world, physical problem by making it an abstract one, one that is solvable intellectually without any physical work. They could imagine better and cleverly. The inventions are constructed in the mind of their inventor, and we say abstraction it. Therefore, if we make a lot of abstraction about the invention or machine, we can have the best engineering devices. So engineering developing thanks to abstraction. We describe to hard thing and it will be easy for us. We can say abstraction is symbol of nothingnessSometimes we can not explain everything with mathematical symbols, so abstraction help us about thisAbstraction is also generalization, and it is important to engineering. Abstraction provides us more exact conclusions on our calculations and studies in the branches of science. It helps us deeply and more effective work while we\\'re working on problems. It helps us solve our problems in our head without actually doing some difficult experiments, And It also helps us understand some theories that are not suitable for modeling in real world, such as binary system or transistors that says is on and is off, which is related to electric currency. We do not take the data we do not need to throw them away, so we can focus on data we need clearly. Today we abstract our ideas and tomorrow we can execute our ideas for real in engineering, because if we want the make something happens, we need to think what to do, We need to imagine and after that we can do things that we imagined. For example, we had started thinking better, so we did smart works. With an Abstraction it possible to explain experiments or research that couldn\\'t observe the results. The in physical life It makes our job easierWith using this method used to understand and predict. Bring more rational answer to us progressive and cumulative science improved with that way.  Existing in thought or an idea but not have a physical form could calculate the area of house by thinking abstraction example thinking the area of house as a square. There is a saying \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\". As we understand from this quote, abstraction is the step right before the real application. In order to invent new devices, technologies, etc. we should take the abstract and apply it by using sciences such as physics and math. Calculus is also related. Isaac Newton did studies on abstract math and couldn\\'t apply all of them into reality, but today many works of engineering is based on Newton\\'s studies. With abstraction, humanity can build building more easy and stronger. We found zero with abstraction, and we can describe it with use abstraction. Then we solved a lot of problems with use zero. Also, we can find answer to difficult questions. We can solve the measly. Abstraction is very important for us because we need to understand how to solve a problem. Especially math and physics can do it. So if we learn them we can be better, engineer better. It helps us make problem to things that we can solve, For instance calculating the size of pyramids. We abstract the problem into the mind so that we can figure it out how we can do.  It helps us think more creatively. Thus we can make complicated problems to simply ones. Then we solve the problems easily or we understand nature.  We are using this predicts and abstract some ideas for prove for example we want to make new, invent or work firstly we abstract that matter and then we apply.  Abstraction is an obligation because we know a lot of theorems, rules and calculations, but all of them are general. But when we have a real problem we should transform the base problem into a case (rule, theorem or equation) and we always use abstraction to do this. Abstraction is transforming the problem unsolvable to solvable. So if we focus on this basics, abstraction can help us better.  Abstraction turns a problem to mathematically form, and we can use calculus.  We imagine and generalize problems in our mind. Then we solve it in our minister we understand the problem and solution after that we will be able to find a strict solution or proven function.  \"There is a saying \"\"today\\'s abstract mathematic is future\\'s applied mathematic\"\", so every abstract idea can be applied and useful abstraction is necessary for engineering\".  Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. The thing what I am trying to say is color of a car has no meaning for computer unless we teach it with right abstraction technique. , For example, in Abstraction means removal of details. Essentially you remove unnecessary details to get a clear view. Typically, you want to be able to analyze/demonstrate/prove/communicate/verify/validate a set of properties based on informed design decisions. Seeing the design in the code is like trying to perceive the forest while walking among the trees. You see cues but not the forest. Different purposes need different abstractions.  Abstraction helps to us about thinking. When we use it we can do anything as mathematically what we cannot feel in realistic world. So we can think about infinity and use it. We can also use zero in problem-solving or calculating.  It helps us to do the distinct disciplines better. For instance, people used it to laid of foundations, mathematics and engineering. Also, Before, Civilizations of Ancient Greek used abstraction and abstract mathematics to give a meaning of numbers and explain the science a bit rationallyAbstraction is a kind of bridge for the applied math and engineering and there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math, Tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'\\'. It shows us The science is cumulative and progressive.  \"We can not do every thing with applied science, but if we use abstraction we can imagine it easily. For example, zero we can not feel or touching, but we can imagine with abstraction, and we use in applied engineering qualitative to quantitative\". We use math for abstraction nature. So we always look at the nature for making a new product.  Abstraction helps us to do engineering better. Objects are real and creating shapes from objects helps engineering to think better. Shaping thinking, creating multiple universes, more dimensions. If- we didn\\'t use abstraction. Many things can not understandable for calculations. For example, when Greeks found PI, abstraction helped to find this number It also helped for creating mathematical philosophy like quantum mathematics or etc. it helps us think more creatively, that we can make problems completely in easier way. When we do abstraction the problem can be more clearly, and we can find a solution to solve it fast.  \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrows applied math. For less effort we used abstraction. We can guess something, for example distance between Earth and Moon. Approximation helped us. Instant of change and Calculus\". Abstraction helps engineer to think more openly, and it makes us generalize the things that we thought. There are things in World that can be representative. By abstraction It makes easier to think and solve the problems sought to those problems. If we don\\'t teach the computer what it should know, we can\\'t make it work. For example, we should teach computer that what color or shine is? Abstraction helps us in many ways in science, Not only engineering. Also, we use abstraction in math and mathematical expressions. We calculate very big numbers, distances. Science is abstract description, mathematics using nature. \"Abstraction help us about thinking and solving problems. In the other hand, abstraction helps us convert abstraction math to applied math. So abstraction makes us strong against problems. It contributed creating new technologies and fields\". \"It helps to imagine problems as models and helps to find logical solutions for real life problems And also it helps to think theoretically and obtain new formulas and relations\". Abstraction provide us more exact conclusions. Like Abstraction help us to eliminate wrong results and trying to reach perfect result. Observing nature and finding some problems are fundamental steps of the science. Every day we solve a lot of problems. Engineers also must solve these problems. Abstraction helps us do engineering better because in daily life we observe the nature, find the problem and abstract the things. When we find problem we should think about how can we solve it. That moment we need to abstract it, Predict what kind of problem is, and our approach should be correct. Today we abstract some problems, tomorrow problems will be applied. -. We can\\'t explain our theories or plans without abstraction example, we all know the fact that if you throw a ball to air, it fallout we can\\'t explain the mathematical truth of this event explain it we use abstraction In engineering it\\'s similar, because if you want to invent something first you have to plan and calculate things. For those you must use numbers at least. And as we know, the numbers are abstraction. We use it everywhere in engineeringAlso the future engineers can look back and inspire from them, so they will be able to invent better things. Abstraction helps us about functioning the function in our mind, and it is important to engineer because today s abstract thinking, tomorrow s reality. \"It makes us abstract issue of real life in your head by math \". Abstraction help us to predict of the problem, Observe the nature and find the. With abstraction of the problem And solution of abstraction we\\'re trying to fins rational answer for problem. Also, abstraction made of Mathematics. Abstraction is a method which we can think no existing object or content. Because of this We can plane building a stricter without actually build. Thanks to abstraction. Abstraction is an indispensable tool in the engineering process. Engineers can improve their ability to relate physically distinct conceptsAbstracting concrete events.  Abstraction removes the connections to real world and make them generic so that we can think processes and make operations simply. Important theorems and rules, generally based on abstract math. Today\\'s abstract mats is tomorrows applied math. So we are using rules, information and theorems which discovered by abstraction years ago, and it helps us for better engineering. -, because we learned how to better with limes and this make us think about it. -. They practice agriculture and they\\'re calculating abstract things.  Helps us to think more efficiently and more creatively and helps us to solve the problems by different ways and testing methods to solve problems. Zero is the most important abstraction. Defining something that does not exist always was one of the biggest question marks in people\\'s mind, even back in Ancient Greece. However, now we know that in binary, in computers\\' life language, zero is one of the most important aspects. Things exist, and they don\\'t binary and, in its essence, zero. lets us define those that do not exist Whenever we code something that has no value, something that has no name.  Is one of the most used defining methods in engineering. Zero volt energy means we don\\'t have any electric. If we have zero amount of a material, that building can\\'t use that material. In essence, engineering is having one thing and not having the other one. Zero is the name we give to those we do not have.  \"Abstraction helps to us, like thinking about the zero\"\"\"\"Because zero is nothing, but we can think about zero. It is not just that We should think about. Bathmat is meanless if we can not think about like in integer and limit, you should think infinity and approaching to infinityThere is a lot of examples. Today\\'s abstraction is tomorrow\\'s applied Math \".  If there is a problem, we can take it into an abstraction form and solve it with using mathematics formulas. It helps us to think about a solution.  It is really important because we need to start from thinking, And abstraction help us to see what is our plan and what are we going to do. Furthermore, it gives us a logic and ideas. There is a saying which is \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrows applied math. \" For example, if we are planning to make mobile app, first we need to make abstraction, which is defined what we are going to use for technology. Or it is also same with classes. In programming to, we are doing abstraction. For example, we have users, so we need to define usernames and surnames, and it is the abstraction, It is like blueprinting.  Abstraction is turning real life problems into the ones that we can solve on our minds. That includes turning them into a mathematical one as well. So abstraction helps us do engineering better, because we can actually do calculations if we abstract real life problems into the ones that we can solve.  We can apply math in something we can face in daily life. We can abstract a problem in to smaller pieces and its easier the solve and we can apply math to this problem. , it is modelling the structures and that helps to engineer. Engineer solves problems and thinks better with abstraction.  \"Abstraction is making together things to get them understand easily. It\\'s like you have something smaller, and you put a few of them together, and you get a bigger thing, and you use the bigger thing for your next project instead of using small thing again and again. For example, you have a function in a program, you just call it when you need it. You\\'re not typing the commands that inside the that function again and again. So in that way engineering, math, physic became more understandable and easy to use, and they put real life problems into math. That is abstraction\".  Today\\'s abstract math. Tomorrows applied Mathis the early parts of project. If engineer thinks abstractly, next moves can be easy and engineer can make next steps easier. Abstract thinking is predicting. We can think things better with abstraction, for example on mathematics. If we use abstraction, we can applied it in programs robots etc., It helps us to think and be creative helps us find solutions to the problems we can\\'t solve by simply testing, such as infinite problems. , We can easily understand the problems with abstraction because its help us to imagine the problem in our Minuit. Helps us a lot because engineer must solve problems quickly and the best way he/she can. I wish to start a sentence Today\\'s abstract math, tomorrow\\'s practice math. It means that we need to first bring an idea, with abstraction whether or not possible. For example, Jules Verne when he first wrote to \"A\\'a Calculus\" he has seen to other people as crazy or abstract, but his dream comes true after decades. The point I\\'m trying to make here is that as engineer, we mostly can\\'t do things that doesn\\'t thought, and in the process of thinking these things, abstraction is crucial. , Abstraction means solving the real life problems with using our minds. Abstraction help us the generalize our problems and make a solution from our knowledge. With using abstraction we can make our delicious easier. Abstraction makes us generalize and think out of the box. We can make theories without any information and prove the hypothesis.  Abstraction helps us solve real life problems. With mathematics and calculus We abstract the information on mechanics and apply the information to real life problems. It helps us approximate the solution better. Archimedes used this on approximating pi. , IF. you had a problem. You should understand that in that helps you to convert it to mathematic, mathematical language. Otherwise you can\\'t abstract things. Procrastination by infinity instant changes. Cumulative information help IF. you had three things square, triangle and circle. If. you don\\'t abstract them. You can\\'t solve and explain infinity problems. -, We can abstract mathematical things from their physical bindings and make them more general so that we can use it for more problems. Since abstraction is a process of conceptualizing things, it simplifies things and gives us a different perspective to provide a clearer approach It turns a big problem into a smaller problem. When we have a problem, we can abstract it so that it can become simplified, which makes us understand the problems better and come up with solutions easier. If we know how inside the job works, we can do better at outside the job toothed we abstract a machine or a job we can learn about. How is it doing that thing inside the machine? , It helps us to see the problem\\'s solutions in different ways It also helps us to create new ideas and solutions sometimes, when calculating is limited, it helps us to think in different parallels since engineering is a job that needs creativity and maybe a bit overthinking an engineer should learn and know how to abstract something in their mind. Of course, it increased the limits of our brains and our imagination. But the real reason why abstraction helped us is not using any tools. When we are doing abstraction, You can approximately calculate the rocks in the Konyaaltı just in your mind. In this situation, thinking about something that needs math or physics is getting easier to get the results. That takes engineering abilities in our mind to different level. By that we never wait for a calculator to do something about engineering. And also it makes us think hard things as a quick, easy problems. It helps us to think theoretically. It generalizes the idea/problem. Abstraction provide easier way to do engineering. We can imagine and then write it by codes so that important work emerge. For instance, let us think a shop. This shop needs a program because they cannot follow the stocks. A computer engineer for solving this problem. Imagine and can improve an application. , to solve a nature problem with math. Firstly we can understand it, and we can understand it in real. But we can apply this to math because in math there are many answers. So we firstly attraction a problem, and then we can apply to math this problem.  Abstraction helps us engineers with preparing algorithms to our problems. It helps us think about the problem first and how to solve it. , Abstraction is taking the problems in nature and trying to solve them with symbols. Mathematic is a perfect way to abstract a problem. In engineering we have to come up with functions to solve problems. These functions are mathematical problems. Therefore, we always abstract our problems to solve them. , by making people think efficiently. For example, there is a saying \"today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrows applied math\", which means the mathematical terms we are thinking about but can\\'t really comprehend today, for example some kind of paradoxes or some theorems that are not proven yet, will possibly be taught at high schools in the future. So it\\'s a cumulative thing. The abstraction we do today is going to help the engineers in the future. , Engineers need to prove their. It is helping us while we are proving something. It helps us find solutions to specifically physical problems. Abstracting is making problems easier to solve while using logic, physics, instantaneous values and mathematics, and especially calculus. We can use abstraction, then differentiation and integral so that measurement and engineering is easier. Abstraction in mathematics helped in a good way to engineering better. Also, the way we think, and the way see today is more beyond the space and time. It helped us to make sense things we can\\'t actually see in reality. Abstraction helps us to understand better axioms. Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. We understand better with formulas. We need to start thinking and to do that we need to understand what we are supposed to think. When trying to solve a problem through engineering, one can\\'t always have a solid physical sight to think or calculate something beforehand. Math is the language of engineering and physics and helps us to think and visualize in an abstract way. That could prevent giant mistakes and accidents. \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s engineering math. Abstraction helps us to use unknown things\". That makes easier to predict the next step and think about a problem and its solution. We can abstract some physical things to Mathematical or other Scientific models with abstraction So it can help us to understand and make better industrial or daily things. We can do engineering better thanks to abstraction. - Helps engineers foresee the problems and makes it possible to take precautions in order to solve the problem before it happens.  When we abstract something before we work on it, it is easier to get over this problem and cheaper and time-saver because we first use imagination. So the problem can be more solvable and our approach to problem become more fast. , They can think correctly of calculations. Abstraction provided the abstract math become the applied math which we use today in modern system. Also, there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\' applied math\\'\\'. Besides, algebra is big effect in the engineering. Al Khwarizmi is the father of algebra. , We can imagine the problem in our head by abstraction. For example, we can take an easy real-life problem and transfer it to in our head. By that way problem will get easier. This will make think and discuss better. We can do abstract solving.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":60}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with open(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/NLP_PROJECT/QAs-3.txt\",'w+') as my_file:\n","  my_file.write(text)"],"metadata":{"id":"u6WFf1El7lwy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text = text.replace(\" , \",\" \")\n","text"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":123},"id":"PK3PZpnN7nVb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669751393108,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":313,"user":{"displayName":"Mert Bayraktar","userId":"05383922882662101824"}},"outputId":"663c6c1f-d218-43e1-d224-aa8fe39a4788"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["' Abstraction is generalizing concepts. Engineers can use this for calculating abstract things. This helps for engineers to solving abstract problems. Abstraction is useful for think easily.  \"Invested Zero and then invested number. First binary system. Then we calculate some science and math problems with this invested \".  There is a famous line today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied, Which means that we developed math and better way to express things with abstract math.  Abstraction is one of the greatest tool of the engineer. By abstracting a problem we can solve little pieces of a bigger problem and connect all the at the end.  \"Before, abstract Math is today\\'s proven science\". Some ideas can be abstract now. However, it might be proven by other scientists in the future. So it is important to get a development.  With abstraction, we can understand things that difficult to understand. Approximation law by infinity, instant change, abstract predict interest, approximation, senate tragedy, democracy. - \"Zero is representative abstraction. Thus calculating and engineering are better \".  \"Nothingness or having nothing. It gives rise. The ability for a common person to be able to do mathematics isn’t. Before it, mathematicians struggled to perform the simplest arithmetic calculations. Zero helps generalize nothingness\".  It helps us to make calculations calculating more easily. It helps us to generalize things. For instance, before the invention of, they just use nothing. Invention of zero helps to generalize and representing nothingness. We observe nature and convert it to theory information.  \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. Everything is easier with abstract math. \".  With abstraction, you can understand examples and problem time in engineering process. Thorugh abstraction when you solved problem, so you will be able to translate problem which solved from one branch of engineering into another. So you will gain time and money because you won\\'t spend money and time to solve them again.  \"Abstraction is important because algorithm Engineers can see something, but they don\\'t understand something. What can they understand? Send to some object they can easily use to understand and predict\". -, \"because abstraction helps us to think that we will do before doing it. It shows us what we do actually but not completed. It decreases the cost of product\".  \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Old people know to \"\"How can we add something from past\"\" and they are perfect searcher. Because of that. Their engineering was good Egypt, Greeks, Rome\".  To solve any problem in life, first you have to abstract it to the formal math language. And also abstraction helps us to put things in groups, natural numbersfull numbers. Those all are kind an abstraction. Even one of the most significant invention of math, the zero, is the most important abstraction example in math. It helped us to create based system. With that way we could define huge quantities and got many, many benefits.  Abstraction help us when we need to calculate math, physics problem without abstraction. We cannot do this thing. For example, if we calculate diameter, a radius or something like that we need abstactionand this thing help us engineer to creative things, for example coding and thinking about coding, deep thinking, all of this thing s abstraction. For example, zero. Zero actually meanings nothing. It is abstract math But with zero you can do many calculations for engineering easily. On the other, and we used abstraction to solve some physical problems, We abstract the physical problem and solve them with using some mathematical methods. It is quite important for engineering. We can solve some problems better with abstraction. It is really important for the engineering.  \"Solving problems easily with abstraction. Engineering handles the problems if problems selected one by one. What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Government? What is the role of the theater in the Ancient Greece and Rome. How does abstraction help us do engineering better? What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth\".  Abstraction is generalizing complex things. Abstract math helps us to understand engineering better. For example, and (binary digits) makes easy to understand computer And people developed new computer language using abstraction And we can understand computer easier.  Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. I mean color of shoe has no meaning for computer unless we teach it via usage of abstraction technique. For example, invention of zero is also type of abstraction (that is comes from Indian religion \"Nirvana\"). Anything you see in the real world can be represented on computer. Via using Abstraction We can represent their functions and ability. Being represented of something allows us to get everything from real world via abstraction. For example, let\\'s assume you have a car In computer science you can represent it with usage of classes. Also you can create example of that class. Class can have field and functions of it represent thing.  Its help to imagine.  Abstraction is helping us for be good engineerThanks to abstraction we can use thinking more analytical again thanks to abstraction we can use zero in our current counting systemBecause abstraction is helping us to think about nothingness and existence. \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? It makes simple, do that It help us the solutions for questions. Abstraction is a thinking freely \". With using abstraction we can shorten the average time we\\'re going to spend on a work. Its simply more efficient. \" How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Roma\\'s civilization engineering for military. Greeks used to math observe and explain for science Cause and effect(Aristotle). Use the math, prove, Observe nature and explain Science can find all Aristotle\\'s deductive(Tümdengelim) \". \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Improve, establish, invented observation, approximation, approximate politic, economy, infrastructure, law, people, conflict of interest, play, rule, predict abstract conclusion.

What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Government view\". If there is a problem, and we have to solve it, we should abstract it in our mind. So this helps us to solve this problem easily. An engineer is always going to face many of problems and wants to solve them Because it is his job To make easy the solutions. Abstraction is very helpful selection, For instance, a civil engineer might face to a problem when construct a build. If he/she use abstraction - he thinks the problem in his/her mind as abstract - the problem will be easier to solve. For example, in real world the thinks aren\\'t perfectly shaped, But in geometry we can assume that there are perfect shapes and can do calculations on them.  Abstraction is important because people use that to improve science. People improved the science, engineering would be better.  Abstraction helps us do engineering better. Zero limit, infinity. We know something there, but we do not know how much. Approximation, science, inconsistency, arbitraryInconsistency between themInduction of ideas Rome, Ancient GreeceFunction \"abstraction helps us think better of problem and find the best solution way engineering better. \". It provides us thinking more efficient, and then we do engineering better.  Abstraction helps us do engineering betterBecause abstraction is important at the theaterExample Romans theater and Greeks theater is different Greek\\'s theater platform is circle of them helps us do engineering better. \"The formal language to computers is binary, which is passing on zeros and ones, and zero is an abstraction \". \"We can calculate easier with abstractionToday some things easier to understand. With abstraction. We can easily imagine some thingsAbstraction make easier the engineering. \". In early ages there were very little amounts of knowledge and engineering systems, so abstraction helped them with creativity, solving problems, creating something. All of them could be existed with thinking abstract. \"Zero is the most abstraction. Zero had been invented for easier calculations and abstract mathematic. For example. When ı use computer, most users unaware the inner workings in the computer. I can learn this because of abstraction \". Abstraction helps to avoid time-wasting and prevents problems before they happen, because we imagine before we take action and see those problems, so we prevent those problems.  Abstraction is a thinking way. It help us find solutions to specifically or hard physical problems. You can abstract a problem basically in your mind, and you can solve this problem on your mind. After that you can solve this problem on real life because you find a way with thinking, and you know what to do.  In some problems we may not have as many as matter to solve the problems abstraction helps us to solve our problem without even having the materiality this way, now, engineering came so far. \"\\'Today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'. We can use and calculate the equation by abstraction, and then we can use this thing in applied math and engineering like Pyramids\". \"Some calculating needs more effort than ordinary human can. So in this reason, especially in math, people had to assume some steps that they can\\'t do in order to complete the thing that they started, For example calculating PI. Also, reality has some limit that you can\\'t surpass, but abstraction can make you feel free when you think about something. \". Abstraction helps us solve a real world, physical problem by making it an abstract one, one that is solvable intellectually without any physical work. They could imagine better and cleverly. The inventions are constructed in the mind of their inventor, and we say abstraction it. Therefore, if we make a lot of abstraction about the invention or machine, we can have the best engineering devices. So engineering developing thanks to abstraction. We describe to hard thing and it will be easy for us. We can say abstraction is symbol of nothingnessSometimes we can not explain everything with mathematical symbols, so abstraction help us about thisAbstraction is also generalization, and it is important to engineering. Abstraction provides us more exact conclusions on our calculations and studies in the branches of science. It helps us deeply and more effective work while we\\'re working on problems. It helps us solve our problems in our head without actually doing some difficult experiments, And It also helps us understand some theories that are not suitable for modeling in real world, such as binary system or transistors that says is on and is off, which is related to electric currency. We do not take the data we do not need to throw them away, so we can focus on data we need clearly. Today we abstract our ideas and tomorrow we can execute our ideas for real in engineering, because if we want the make something happens, we need to think what to do, We need to imagine and after that we can do things that we imagined. For example, we had started thinking better, so we did smart works. With an Abstraction it possible to explain experiments or research that couldn\\'t observe the results. The in physical life It makes our job easierWith using this method used to understand and predict. Bring more rational answer to us progressive and cumulative science improved with that way.  Existing in thought or an idea but not have a physical form could calculate the area of house by thinking abstraction example thinking the area of house as a square. There is a saying \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\". As we understand from this quote, abstraction is the step right before the real application. In order to invent new devices, technologies, etc. we should take the abstract and apply it by using sciences such as physics and math. Calculus is also related. Isaac Newton did studies on abstract math and couldn\\'t apply all of them into reality, but today many works of engineering is based on Newton\\'s studies. With abstraction, humanity can build building more easy and stronger. We found zero with abstraction, and we can describe it with use abstraction. Then we solved a lot of problems with use zero. Also, we can find answer to difficult questions. We can solve the measly. Abstraction is very important for us because we need to understand how to solve a problem. Especially math and physics can do it. So if we learn them we can be better, engineer better. It helps us make problem to things that we can solve, For instance calculating the size of pyramids. We abstract the problem into the mind so that we can figure it out how we can do.  It helps us think more creatively. Thus we can make complicated problems to simply ones. Then we solve the problems easily or we understand nature.  We are using this predicts and abstract some ideas for prove for example we want to make new, invent or work firstly we abstract that matter and then we apply.  Abstraction is an obligation because we know a lot of theorems, rules and calculations, but all of them are general. But when we have a real problem we should transform the base problem into a case (rule, theorem or equation) and we always use abstraction to do this. Abstraction is transforming the problem unsolvable to solvable. So if we focus on this basics, abstraction can help us better.  Abstraction turns a problem to mathematically form, and we can use calculus.  We imagine and generalize problems in our mind. Then we solve it in our minister we understand the problem and solution after that we will be able to find a strict solution or proven function.  \"There is a saying \"\"today\\'s abstract mathematic is future\\'s applied mathematic\"\", so every abstract idea can be applied and useful abstraction is necessary for engineering\".  Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. The thing what I am trying to say is color of a car has no meaning for computer unless we teach it with right abstraction technique. For example, in Abstraction means removal of details. Essentially you remove unnecessary details to get a clear view. Typically, you want to be able to analyze/demonstrate/prove/communicate/verify/validate a set of properties based on informed design decisions. Seeing the design in the code is like trying to perceive the forest while walking among the trees. You see cues but not the forest. Different purposes need different abstractions.  Abstraction helps to us about thinking. When we use it we can do anything as mathematically what we cannot feel in realistic world. So we can think about infinity and use it. We can also use zero in problem-solving or calculating.  It helps us to do the distinct disciplines better. For instance, people used it to laid of foundations, mathematics and engineering. Also, Before, Civilizations of Ancient Greek used abstraction and abstract mathematics to give a meaning of numbers and explain the science a bit rationallyAbstraction is a kind of bridge for the applied math and engineering and there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math, Tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'\\'. It shows us The science is cumulative and progressive.  \"We can not do every thing with applied science, but if we use abstraction we can imagine it easily. For example, zero we can not feel or touching, but we can imagine with abstraction, and we use in applied engineering qualitative to quantitative\". We use math for abstraction nature. So we always look at the nature for making a new product.  Abstraction helps us to do engineering better. Objects are real and creating shapes from objects helps engineering to think better. Shaping thinking, creating multiple universes, more dimensions. If- we didn\\'t use abstraction. Many things can not understandable for calculations.

For example, we should teach computer that what color or shine is? Abstraction helps us in many ways in science, Not only engineering. Also, we use abstraction in math and mathematical expressions. We calculate very big numbers, distances. Science is abstract description, mathematics using nature. \"Abstraction help us about thinking and solving problems. In the other hand, abstraction helps us convert abstraction math to applied math. So abstraction makes us strong against problems. It contributed creating new technologies and fields\". \"It helps to imagine problems as models and helps to find logical solutions for real life problems And also it helps to think theoretically and obtain new formulas and relations\". Abstraction provide us more exact conclusions. Like Abstraction help us to eliminate wrong results and trying to reach perfect result. Observing nature and finding some problems are fundamental steps of the science. Every day we solve a lot of problems. Engineers also must solve these problems. Abstraction helps us do engineering better because in daily life we observe the nature, find the problem and abstract the things. When we find problem we should think about how can we solve it. That moment we need to abstract it, Predict what kind of problem is, and our approach should be correct. Today we abstract some problems, tomorrow problems will be applied. -. We can\\'t explain our theories or plans without abstraction example, we all know the fact that if you throw a ball to air, it fallout we can\\'t explain the mathematical truth of this event explain it we use abstraction In engineering it\\'s similar, because if you want to invent something first you have to plan and calculate things. For those you must use numbers at least. And as we know, the numbers are abstraction. We use it everywhere in engineeringAlso the future engineers can look back and inspire from them, so they will be able to invent better things. Abstraction helps us about functioning the function in our mind, and it is important to engineer because today s abstract thinking, tomorrow s reality. \"It makes us abstract issue of real life in your head by math \". Abstraction help us to predict of the problem, Observe the nature and find the. With abstraction of the problem And solution of abstraction we\\'re trying to fins rational answer for problem. Also, abstraction made of Mathematics. Abstraction is a method which we can think no existing object or content. Because of this We can plane building a stricter without actually build. Thanks to abstraction. Abstraction is an indispensable tool in the engineering process. Engineers can improve their ability to relate physically distinct conceptsAbstracting concrete events.  Abstraction removes the connections to real world and make them generic so that we can think processes and make operations simply. Important theorems and rules, generally based on abstract math. Today\\'s abstract mats is tomorrows applied math. So we are using rules, information and theorems which discovered by abstraction years ago, and it helps us for better engineering. -, because we learned how to better with limes and this make us think about it. -. They practice agriculture and they\\'re calculating abstract things.  Helps us to think more efficiently and more creatively and helps us to solve the problems by different ways and testing methods to solve problems. Zero is the most important abstraction. Defining something that does not exist always was one of the biggest question marks in people\\'s mind, even back in Ancient Greece. However, now we know that in binary, in computers\\' life language, zero is one of the most important aspects. Things exist, and they don\\'t binary and, in its essence, zero. lets us define those that do not exist Whenever we code something that has no value, something that has no name.  Is one of the most used defining methods in engineering. Zero volt energy means we don\\'t have any electric. If we have zero amount of a material, that building can\\'t use that material. In essence, engineering is having one thing and not having the other one. Zero is the name we give to those we do not have.  \"Abstraction helps to us, like thinking about the zero\"\"\"\"Because zero is nothing, but we can think about zero. It is not just that We should think about. Bathmat is meanless if we can not think about like in integer and limit, you should think infinity and approaching to infinityThere is a lot of examples. Today\\'s abstraction is tomorrow\\'s applied Math \".  If there is a problem, we can take it into an abstraction form and solve it with using mathematics formulas. It helps us to think about a solution.  It is really important because we need to start from thinking, And abstraction help us to see what is our plan and what are we going to do. Furthermore, it gives us a logic and ideas. There is a saying which is \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrows applied math. \" For example, if we are planning to make mobile app, first we need to make abstraction, which is defined what we are going to use for technology. Or it is also same with classes. In programming to, we are doing abstraction. For example, we have users, so we need to define usernames and surnames, and it is the abstraction, It is like blueprinting.  Abstraction is turning real life problems into the ones that we can solve on our minds. That includes turning them into a mathematical one as well. So abstraction helps us do engineering better, because we can actually do calculations if we abstract real life problems into the ones that we can solve.  We can apply math in something we can face in daily life. We can abstract a problem in to smaller pieces and its easier the solve and we can apply math to this problem. it is modelling the structures and that helps to engineer. Engineer solves problems and thinks better with abstraction.  \"Abstraction is making together things to get them understand easily. It\\'s like you have something smaller, and you put a few of them together, and you get a bigger thing, and you use the bigger thing for your next project instead of using small thing again and again. For example, you have a function in a program, you just call it when you need it. You\\'re not typing the commands that inside the that function again and again. So in that way engineering, math, physic became more understandable and easy to use, and they put real life problems into math. That is abstraction\".  Today\\'s abstract math. Tomorrows applied Mathis the early parts of project. If engineer thinks abstractly, next moves can be easy and engineer can make next steps easier. Abstract thinking is predicting. We can think things better with abstraction, for example on mathematics. If we use abstraction, we can applied it in programs robots etc., It helps us to think and be creative helps us find solutions to the problems we can\\'t solve by simply testing, such as infinite problems. We can easily understand the problems with abstraction because its help us to imagine the problem in our Minuit. Helps us a lot because engineer must solve problems quickly and the best way he/she can. I wish to start a sentence Today\\'s abstract math, tomorrow\\'s practice math. It means that we need to first bring an idea, with abstraction whether or not possible. For example, Jules Verne when he first wrote to \"A\\'a Calculus\" he has seen to other people as crazy or abstract, but his dream comes true after decades. The point I\\'m trying to make here is that as engineer, we mostly can\\'t do things that doesn\\'t thought, and in the process of thinking these things, abstraction is crucial. Abstraction means solving the real life problems with using our minds. Abstraction help us the generalize our problems and make a solution from our knowledge. With using abstraction we can make our delicious easier. Abstraction makes us generalize and think out of the box. We can make theories without any information and prove the hypothesis.  Abstraction helps us solve real life problems. With mathematics and calculus We abstract the information on mechanics and apply the information to real life problems. It helps us approximate the solution better. Archimedes used this on approximating pi. IF. you had a problem. You should understand that in that helps you to convert it to mathematic, mathematical language. Otherwise you can\\'t abstract things. Procrastination by infinity instant changes. Cumulative information help IF. you had three things square, triangle and circle. If. you don\\'t abstract them. You can\\'t solve and explain infinity problems. -, We can abstract mathematical things from their physical bindings and make them more general so that we can use it for more problems. Since abstraction is a process of conceptualizing things, it simplifies things and gives us a different perspective to provide a clearer approach It turns a big problem into a smaller problem. When we have a problem, we can abstract it so that it can become simplified, which makes us understand the problems better and come up with solutions easier. If we know how inside the job works, we can do better at outside the job toothed we abstract a machine or a job we can learn about. How is it doing that thing inside the machine? It helps us to see the problem\\'s solutions in different ways It also helps us to create new ideas and solutions sometimes, when calculating is limited, it helps us to think in different parallels since engineering is a job that needs creativity and maybe a bit overthinking an engineer should learn and know how to abstract something in their mind. Of course, it increased the limits of our brains and our imagination. But the real reason why abstraction helped us is not using any tools. When we are doing abstraction, You can approximately calculate the rocks in the Konyaaltı just in your mind. In this situation, thinking about something that needs math or physics is getting easier to get the results. That takes engineering abilities in our mind to different level. By that we never wait for a calculator to do something about engineering. And also it makes us think hard things as a quick, easy problems. It helps us to think theoretically. It generalizes the idea/problem. Abstraction provide easier way to do engineering. We can imagine and then write it by codes so that important work emerge. For instance, let us think a shop. This shop needs a program because they cannot follow the stocks. A computer engineer for solving this problem. Imagine and can improve an application. to solve a nature problem with math. Firstly we can understand it, and we can understand it in real. But we can apply this to math because in math there are many answers. So we firstly attraction a problem, and then we can apply to math this problem.  Abstraction helps us engineers with preparing algorithms to our problems. It helps us think about the problem first and how to solve it. Abstraction is taking the problems in nature and trying to solve them with symbols. Mathematic is a perfect way to abstract a problem. In engineering we have to come up with functions to solve problems. These functions are mathematical problems. Therefore, we always abstract our problems to solve them. by making people think efficiently. For example, there is a saying \"today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrows applied math\", which means the mathematical terms we are thinking about but can\\'t really comprehend today, for example some kind of paradoxes or some theorems that are not proven yet, will possibly be taught at high schools in the future. So it\\'s a cumulative thing. The abstraction we do today is going to help the engineers in the future. Engineers need to prove their. It is helping us while we are proving something. It helps us find solutions to specifically physical problems. Abstracting is making problems easier to solve while using logic, physics, instantaneous values and mathematics, and especially calculus. We can use abstraction, then differentiation and integral so that measurement and engineering is easier. Abstraction in mathematics helped in a good way to engineering better. Also, the way we think, and the way see today is more beyond the space and time. It helped us to make sense things we can\\'t actually see in reality. Abstraction helps us to understand better axioms. Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. We understand better with formulas. We need to start thinking and to do that we need to understand what we are supposed to think. When trying to solve a problem through engineering, one can\\'t always have a solid physical sight to think or calculate something beforehand. Math is the language of engineering and physics and helps us to think and visualize in an abstract way. That could prevent giant mistakes and accidents. \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s engineering math. Abstraction helps us to use unknown things\". That makes easier to predict the next step and think about a problem and its solution. We can abstract some physical things to Mathematical or other Scientific models with abstraction So it can help us to understand and make better industrial or daily things. We can do engineering better thanks to abstraction. - Helps engineers foresee the problems and makes it possible to take precautions in order to solve the problem before it happens.  When we abstract something before we work on it, it is easier to get over this problem and cheaper and time-saver because we first use imagination. So the problem can be more solvable and our approach to problem become more fast. They can think correctly of calculations. Abstraction provided the abstract math become the applied math which we use today in modern system. Also, there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\' applied math\\'\\'. Besides, algebra is big effect in the engineering. Al Khwarizmi is the father of algebra. We can imagine the problem in our head by abstraction. For example, we can take an easy real-life problem and transfer it to in our head. By that way problem will get easier. This will make think and discuss better. We can do abstract solving.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":62}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with open(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/NLP_PROJECT/QAs-3.txt\",'w+') as my_file:\n","  my_file.write(text)"],"metadata":{"id":"O-npl7Rq8Ed1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with open(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/NLP_PROJECT/QAs-3.txt\") as f:\n","  text = f.read()"],"metadata":{"id":"4fEL__I58GiW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669802675483,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":695,"user":{"displayName":"Mert Bayraktar","userId":"05383922882662101824"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text = text.replace(\"  \", \" \")\n","text"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":192},"id":"Qz9lDtAl_se7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669802690890,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":300,"user":{"displayName":"Mert Bayraktar","userId":"05383922882662101824"}},"outputId":"8b3a6c8e-7785-48a7-8fa1-4ee64da0ebbf"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["' Abstraction is generalizing concepts. Engineers can use this for calculating abstract things. This helps for engineers to solving abstract problems. Abstraction is useful for think easily. \"Invested Zero and then invested number. First binary system. Then we calculate some science and math problems with this invested \". There is a famous line today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied, Which means that we developed math and better way to express things with abstract math. Abstraction is one of the greatest tool of the engineer. By abstracting a problem we can solve little pieces of a bigger problem and connect all the at the end. \"Before, abstract Math is today\\'s proven science\". Some ideas can be abstract now. However, it might be proven by other scientists in the future. So it is important to get a development. With abstraction, we can understand things that difficult to understand. Approximation law by infinity, instant change, abstract predict interest, approximation, senate tragedy, democracy. - \"Zero is representative abstraction. Thus calculating and engineering are better \". \"Nothingness or having nothing. It gives rise. The ability for a common person to be able to do mathematics isn’t. Before it, mathematicians struggled to perform the simplest arithmetic calculations. Zero helps generalize nothingness\". It helps us to make calculations calculating more easily. It helps us to generalize things. For instance, before the invention of, they just use nothing. Invention of zero helps to generalize and representing nothingness. We observe nature and convert it to theory information. \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. Everything is easier with abstract math. \". With abstraction, you can understand examples and problem time in engineering process. Thorugh abstraction when you solved problem, so you will be able to translate problem which solved from one branch of engineering into another. So you will gain time and money because you won\\'t spend money and time to solve them again. \"Abstraction is important because algorithm Engineers can see something, but they don\\'t understand something. What can they understand? Send to some object they can easily use to understand and predict\". -, \"because abstraction helps us to think that we will do before doing it. It shows us what we do actually but not completed. It decreases the cost of product\". \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Old people know to \"\"How can we add something from past\"\" and they are perfect searcher. Because of that. Their engineering was good Egypt, Greeks, Rome\". To solve any problem in life, first you have to abstract it to the formal math language. And also abstraction helps us to put things in groups, natural numbersfull numbers. Those all are kind an abstraction. Even one of the most significant invention of math, the zero, is the most important abstraction example in math. It helped us to create based system. With that way we could define huge quantities and got many, many benefits. Abstraction help us when we need to calculate math, physics problem without abstraction. We cannot do this thing. For example, if we calculate diameter, a radius or something like that we need abstactionand this thing help us engineer to creative things, for example coding and thinking about coding, deep thinking, all of this thing s abstraction. For example, zero. Zero actually meanings nothing. It is abstract math But with zero you can do many calculations for engineering easily. On the other, and we used abstraction to solve some physical problems, We abstract the physical problem and solve them with using some mathematical methods. It is quite important for engineering. We can solve some problems better with abstraction. It is really important for the engineering. \"Solving problems easily with abstraction. Engineering handles the problems if problems selected one by one. What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Government? What is the role of the theater in the Ancient Greece and Rome. How does abstraction help us do engineering better? What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth\". Abstraction is generalizing complex things. Abstract math helps us to understand engineering better. For example, and (binary digits) makes easy to understand computer And people developed new computer language using abstraction And we can understand computer easier. Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. I mean color of shoe has no meaning for computer unless we teach it via usage of abstraction technique. For example, invention of zero is also type of abstraction (that is comes from Indian religion \"Nirvana\"). Anything you see in the real world can be represented on computer. Via using Abstraction We can represent their functions and ability. Being represented of something allows us to get everything from real world via abstraction. For example, let\\'s assume you have a car In computer science you can represent it with usage of classes. Also you can create example of that class. Class can have field and functions of it represent thing. Its help to imagine. Abstraction is helping us for be good engineerThanks to abstraction we can use thinking more analytical again thanks to abstraction we can use zero in our current counting systemBecause abstraction is helping us to think about nothingness and existence. \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? It makes simple, do that It help us the solutions for questions. Abstraction is a thinking freely \". With using abstraction we can shorten the average time we\\'re going to spend on a work. Its simply more efficient. \" How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Roma\\'s civilization engineering for military. Greeks used to math observe and explain for science Cause and effect(Aristotle). Use the math, prove, Observe nature and explain Science can find all Aristotle\\'s deductive(Tümdengelim) \". \"How does abstraction help us do engineering better? Improve, establish, invented observation, approximation, approximate politic, economy, infrastructure, law, people, conflict of interest, play, rule, predict abstract conclusion.

Establish invented, try. What was proposed by the Greeks to account for the retrograde movement of planets orbiting Earth? What is the role of the theater in the Ancient Greece and Rome? What steps are taken to calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon in Ancient Greece? How Romans handle Conflict of Interest in Government view\". If there is a problem, and we have to solve it, we should abstract it in our mind. So this helps us to solve this problem easily. An engineer is always going to face many of problems and wants to solve them Because it is his job To make easy the solutions. Abstraction is very helpful selection, For instance, a civil engineer might face to a problem when construct a build. If he/she use abstraction - he thinks the problem in his/her mind as abstract - the problem will be easier to solve. For example, in real world the thinks aren\\'t perfectly shaped, But in geometry we can assume that there are perfect shapes and can do calculations on them. Abstraction is important because people use that to improve science. People improved the science, engineering would be better. Abstraction helps us do engineering better. Zero limit, infinity. We know something there, but we do not know how much. Approximation, science, inconsistency, arbitraryInconsistency between themInduction of ideas Rome, Ancient GreeceFunction \"abstraction helps us think better of problem and find the best solution way engineering better. \". It provides us thinking more efficient, and then we do engineering better. Abstraction helps us do engineering betterBecause abstraction is important at the theaterExample Romans theater and Greeks theater is different Greek\\'s theater platform is circle of them helps us do engineering better. \"The formal language to computers is binary, which is passing on zeros and ones, and zero is an abstraction \". \"We can calculate easier with abstractionToday some things easier to understand. With abstraction. We can easily imagine some thingsAbstraction make easier the engineering. \". In early ages there were very little amounts of knowledge and engineering systems, so abstraction helped them with creativity, solving problems, creating something. All of them could be existed with thinking abstract. \"Zero is the most abstraction. Zero had been invented for easier calculations and abstract mathematic. For example. When ı use computer, most users unaware the inner workings in the computer. I can learn this because of abstraction \". Abstraction helps to avoid time-wasting and prevents problems before they happen, because we imagine before we take action and see those problems, so we prevent those problems. Abstraction is a thinking way. It help us find solutions to specifically or hard physical problems. You can abstract a problem basically in your mind, and you can solve this problem on your mind. After that you can solve this problem on real life because you find a way with thinking, and you know what to do. In some problems we may not have as many as matter to solve the problems abstraction helps us to solve our problem without even having the materiality this way, now, engineering came so far. \"\\'Today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'. We can use and calculate the equation by abstraction, and then we can use this thing in applied math and engineering like Pyramids\". \"Some calculating needs more effort than ordinary human can. So in this reason, especially in math, people had to assume some steps that they can\\'t do in order to complete the thing that they started, For example calculating PI. Also, reality has some limit that you can\\'t surpass, but abstraction can make you feel free when you think about something. \". Abstraction helps us solve a real world, physical problem by making it an abstract one, one that is solvable intellectually without any physical work. They could imagine better and cleverly. The inventions are constructed in the mind of their inventor, and we say abstraction it. Therefore, if we make a lot of abstraction about the invention or machine, we can have the best engineering devices. So engineering developing thanks to abstraction. We describe to hard thing and it will be easy for us. We can say abstraction is symbol of nothingnessSometimes we can not explain everything with mathematical symbols, so abstraction help us about thisAbstraction is also generalization, and it is important to engineering. Abstraction provides us more exact conclusions on our calculations and studies in the branches of science. It helps us deeply and more effective work while we\\'re working on problems. It helps us solve our problems in our head without actually doing some difficult experiments, And It also helps us understand some theories that are not suitable for modeling in real world, such as binary system or transistors that says is on and is off, which is related to electric currency. We do not take the data we do not need to throw them away, so we can focus on data we need clearly. Today we abstract our ideas and tomorrow we can execute our ideas for real in engineering, because if we want the make something happens, we need to think what to do, We need to imagine and after that we can do things that we imagined. For example, we had started thinking better, so we did smart works. With an Abstraction it possible to explain experiments or research that couldn\\'t observe the results. The in physical life It makes our job easierWith using this method used to understand and predict. Bring more rational answer to us progressive and cumulative science improved with that way. Existing in thought or an idea but not have a physical form could calculate the area of house by thinking abstraction example thinking the area of house as a square. There is a saying \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math\". As we understand from this quote, abstraction is the step right before the real application. In order to invent new devices, technologies, etc. we should take the abstract and apply it by using sciences such as physics and math. Calculus is also related. Isaac Newton did studies on abstract math and couldn\\'t apply all of them into reality, but today many works of engineering is based on Newton\\'s studies. With abstraction, humanity can build building more easy and stronger. We found zero with abstraction, and we can describe it with use abstraction. Then we solved a lot of problems with use zero. Also, we can find answer to difficult questions. We can solve the measly. Abstraction is very important for us because we need to understand how to solve a problem. Especially math and physics can do it. So if we learn them we can be better, engineer better. It helps us make problem to things that we can solve, For instance calculating the size of pyramids. We abstract the problem into the mind so that we can figure it out how we can do. It helps us think more creatively. Thus we can make complicated problems to simply ones. Then we solve the problems easily or we understand nature. We are using this predicts and abstract some ideas for prove for example we want to make new, invent or work firstly we abstract that matter and then we apply. Abstraction is an obligation because we know a lot of theorems, rules and calculations, but all of them are general. But when we have a real problem we should transform the base problem into a case (rule, theorem or equation) and we always use abstraction to do this. Abstraction is transforming the problem unsolvable to solvable. So if we focus on this basics, abstraction can help us better. Abstraction turns a problem to mathematically form, and we can use calculus. We imagine and generalize problems in our mind. Then we solve it in our minister we understand the problem and solution after that we will be able to find a strict solution or proven function. \"There is a saying \"\"today\\'s abstract mathematic is future\\'s applied mathematic\"\", so every abstract idea can be applied and useful abstraction is necessary for engineering\". Things in real world can be represented by abstraction. The thing what I am trying to say is color of a car has no meaning for computer unless we teach it with right abstraction technique. For example, in Abstraction means removal of details. Essentially you remove unnecessary details to get a clear view. Typically, you want to be able to analyze/demonstrate/prove/communicate/verify/validate a set of properties based on informed design decisions. Seeing the design in the code is like trying to perceive the forest while walking among the trees. You see cues but not the forest. Different purposes need different abstractions. Abstraction helps to us about thinking. When we use it we can do anything as mathematically what we cannot feel in realistic world. So we can think about infinity and use it. We can also use zero in problem-solving or calculating. It helps us to do the distinct disciplines better. For instance, people used it to laid of foundations, mathematics and engineering. Also, Before, Civilizations of Ancient Greek used abstraction and abstract mathematics to give a meaning of numbers and explain the science a bit rationallyAbstraction is a kind of bridge for the applied math and engineering and there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math, Tomorrow\\'s applied math\\'\\'. It shows us The science is cumulative and progressive. \"We can not do every thing with applied science, but if we use abstraction we can imagine it easily. For example, zero we can not feel or touching, but we can imagine with abstraction, and we use in applied engineering qualitative to quantitative\". We use math for abstraction nature. So we always look at the nature for making a new product. Abstraction helps us to do engineering better. Objects are real and creating shapes from objects helps engineering to think better. Shaping thinking, creating multiple universes, more dimensions. If- we didn\\'t use abstraction. Many things can not understandable for calculations. For example, when Greeks found PI, abstraction helped to find this number It also helped for creating mathematical philosophy like quantum mathematics or etc. it helps us think more creatively, that we can make problems completely in easier way. When we do abstraction the problem can be more clearly, and we can find a solution to solve it fast. \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrows applied math. For less effort we used abstraction. We can guess something, for example distance between Earth and Moon. Approximation helped us. Instant of change and Calculus\". Abstraction helps engineer to think more openly, and it makes us generalize the things that we thought. There are things in World that can be representative. By abstraction It makes easier to think and solve the problems sought to those problems. If we don\\'t teach the computer what it should know, we can\\'t make it work. For example, we should teach computer that what color or shine is? Abstraction helps us in many ways in science, Not only engineering. Also, we use abstraction in math and mathematical expressions. We calculate very big numbers, distances. Science is abstract description, mathematics using nature. \"Abstraction help us about thinking and solving problems. In the other hand, abstraction helps us convert abstraction math to applied math. So abstraction makes us strong against problems. It contributed creating new technologies and fields\". \"It helps to imagine problems as models and helps to find logical solutions for real life problems And also it helps to think theoretically and obtain new formulas and relations\". Abstraction provide us more exact conclusions. Like Abstraction help us to eliminate wrong results and trying to reach perfect result. Observing nature and finding some problems are fundamental steps of the science. Every day we solve a lot of problems. Engineers also must solve these problems. Abstraction helps us do engineering better because in daily life we observe the nature, find the problem and abstract the things. When we find problem we should think about how can we solve it. That moment we need to abstract it, Predict what kind of problem is, and our approach should be correct. Today we abstract some problems, tomorrow problems will be applied. -. We can\\'t explain our theories or plans without abstraction example, we all know the fact that if you throw a ball to air, it fallout we can\\'t explain the mathematical truth of this event explain it we use abstraction In engineering it\\'s similar, because if you want to invent something first you have to plan and calculate things. For those you must use numbers at least. And as we know, the numbers are abstraction. We use it everywhere in engineeringAlso the future engineers can look back and inspire from them, so they will be able to invent better things. Abstraction helps us about functioning the function in our mind, and it is important to engineer because today s abstract thinking, tomorrow s reality. \"It makes us abstract issue of real life in your head by math \". Abstraction help us to predict of the problem, Observe the nature and find the. With abstraction of the problem And solution of abstraction we\\'re trying to fins rational answer for problem. Also, abstraction made of Mathematics. Abstraction is a method which we can think no existing object or content. Because of this We can plane building a stricter without actually build. Thanks to abstraction. Abstraction is an indispensable tool in the engineering process. Engineers can improve their ability to relate physically distinct conceptsAbstracting concrete events. Abstraction removes the connections to real world and make them generic so that we can think processes and make operations simply. Important theorems and rules, generally based on abstract math. Today\\'s abstract mats is tomorrows applied math. So we are using rules, information and theorems which discovered by abstraction years ago, and it helps us for better engineering. -, because we learned how to better with limes and this make us think about it. -. They practice agriculture and they\\'re calculating abstract things. Helps us to think more efficiently and more creatively and helps us to solve the problems by different ways and testing methods to solve problems. Zero is the most important abstraction. Defining something that does not exist always was one of the biggest question marks in people\\'s mind, even back in Ancient Greece. However, now we know that in binary, in computers\\' life language, zero is one of the most important aspects. Things exist, and they don\\'t binary and, in its essence, zero. lets us define those that do not exist Whenever we code something that has no value, something that has no name. Is one of the most used defining methods in engineering. Zero volt energy means we don\\'t have any electric. If we have zero amount of a material, that building can\\'t use that material. In essence, engineering is having one thing and not having the other one. Zero is the name we give to those we do not have. \"Abstraction helps to us, like thinking about the zero\"\"\"\"Because zero is nothing, but we can think about zero. It is not just that We should think about. Bathmat is meanless if we can not think about like in integer and limit, you should think infinity and approaching to infinityThere is a lot of examples. Today\\'s abstraction is tomorrow\\'s applied Math \". If there is a problem, we can take it into an abstraction form and solve it with using mathematics formulas. It helps us to think about a solution. It is really important because we need to start from thinking, And abstraction help us to see what is our plan and what are we going to do. Furthermore, it gives us a logic and ideas. There is a saying which is \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrows applied math. \" For example, if we are planning to make mobile app, first we need to make abstraction, which is defined what we are going to use for technology. Or it is also same with classes. In programming to, we are doing abstraction. For example, we have users, so we need to define usernames and surnames, and it is the abstraction, It is like blueprinting. Abstraction is turning real life problems into the ones that we can solve on our minds. That includes turning them into a mathematical one as well. So abstraction helps us do engineering better, because we can actually do calculations if we abstract real life problems into the ones that we can solve. We can apply math in something we can face in daily life. We can abstract a problem in to smaller pieces and its easier the solve and we can apply math to this problem. it is modelling the structures and that helps to engineer. Engineer solves problems and thinks better with abstraction. \"Abstraction is making together things to get them understand easily. It\\'s like you have something smaller, and you put a few of them together, and you get a bigger thing, and you use the bigger thing for your next project instead of using small thing again and again. For example, you have a function in a program, you just call it when you need it. You\\'re not typing the commands that inside the that function again and again. So in that way engineering, math, physic became more understandable and easy to use, and they put real life problems into math. That is abstraction\". Today\\'s abstract math. Tomorrows applied Mathis the early parts of project. If engineer thinks abstractly, next moves can be easy and engineer can make next steps easier. Abstract thinking is predicting. We can think things better with abstraction, for example on mathematics. If we use abstraction, we can applied it in programs robots etc., It helps us to think and be creative helps us find solutions to the problems we can\\'t solve by simply testing, such as infinite problems. We can easily understand the problems with abstraction because its help us to imagine the problem in our Minuit. Helps us a lot because engineer must solve problems quickly and the best way he/she can. I wish to start a sentence Today\\'s abstract math, tomorrow\\'s practice math. It means that we need to first bring an idea, with abstraction whether or not possible. For example, Jules Verne when he first wrote to \"A\\'a Calculus\" he has seen to other people as crazy or abstract, but his dream comes true after decades. The point I\\'m trying to make here is that as engineer, we mostly can\\'t do things that doesn\\'t thought, and in the process of thinking these things, abstraction is crucial. Abstraction means solving the real life problems with using our minds. Abstraction help us the generalize our problems and make a solution from our knowledge. With using abstraction we can make our delicious easier. Abstraction makes us generalize and think out of the box. We can make theories without any information and prove the hypothesis. Abstraction helps us solve real life problems. With mathematics and calculus We abstract the information on mechanics and apply the information to real life problems. It helps us approximate the solution better. Archimedes used this on approximating pi. IF. you had a problem. You should understand that in that helps you to convert it to mathematic, mathematical language. Otherwise you can\\'t abstract things. Procrastination by infinity instant changes. Cumulative information help IF. you had three things square, triangle and circle. If. you don\\'t abstract them. You can\\'t solve and explain infinity problems. -, We can abstract mathematical things from their physical bindings and make them more general so that we can use it for more problems. Since abstraction is a process of conceptualizing things, it simplifies things and gives us a different perspective to provide a clearer approach It turns a big problem into a smaller problem. When we have a problem, we can abstract it so that it can become simplified, which makes us understand the problems better and come up with solutions easier. If we know how inside the job works, we can do better at outside the job toothed we abstract a machine or a job we can learn about. How is it doing that thing inside the machine? It helps us to see the problem\\'s solutions in different ways It also helps us to create new ideas and solutions sometimes, when calculating is limited, it helps us to think in different parallels since engineering is a job that needs creativity and maybe a bit overthinking an engineer should learn and know how to abstract something in their mind. Of course, it increased the limits of our brains and our imagination. But the real reason why abstraction helped us is not using any tools. When we are doing abstraction, You can approximately calculate the rocks in the Konyaaltı just in your mind. In this situation, thinking about something that needs math or physics is getting easier to get the results. That takes engineering abilities in our mind to different level. By that we never wait for a calculator to do something about engineering. And also it makes us think hard things as a quick, easy problems. It helps us to think theoretically. It generalizes the idea/problem. Abstraction provide easier way to do engineering. We can imagine and then write it by codes so that important work emerge. For instance, let us think a shop. This shop needs a program because they cannot follow the stocks. A computer engineer for solving this problem. Imagine and can improve an application. to solve a nature problem with math. Firstly we can understand it, and we can understand it in real. But we can apply this to math because in math there are many answers. So we firstly attraction a problem, and then we can apply to math this problem. Abstraction helps us engineers with preparing algorithms to our problems. It helps us think about the problem first and how to solve it. Abstraction is taking the problems in nature and trying to solve them with symbols. Mathematic is a perfect way to abstract a problem. In engineering we have to come up with functions to solve problems. These functions are mathematical problems. Therefore, we always abstract our problems to solve them. by making people think efficiently. For example, there is a saying \"today\\'s abstraction math is tomorrows applied math\", which means the mathematical terms we are thinking about but can\\'t really comprehend today, for example some kind of paradoxes or some theorems that are not proven yet, will possibly be taught at high schools in the future. So it\\'s a cumulative thing. The abstraction we do today is going to help the engineers in the future. Engineers need to prove their. It is helping us while we are proving something. It helps us find solutions to specifically physical problems. Abstracting is making problems easier to solve while using logic, physics, instantaneous values and mathematics, and especially calculus. We can use abstraction, then differentiation and integral so that measurement and engineering is easier. Abstraction in mathematics helped in a good way to engineering better. Also, the way we think, and the way see today is more beyond the space and time. It helped us to make sense things we can\\'t actually see in reality. Abstraction helps us to understand better axioms. Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s applied math. We understand better with formulas. We need to start thinking and to do that we need to understand what we are supposed to think. When trying to solve a problem through engineering, one can\\'t always have a solid physical sight to think or calculate something beforehand. Math is the language of engineering and physics and helps us to think and visualize in an abstract way. That could prevent giant mistakes and accidents. \"Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\'s engineering math. Abstraction helps us to use unknown things\". That makes easier to predict the next step and think about a problem and its solution. We can abstract some physical things to Mathematical or other Scientific models with abstraction So it can help us to understand and make better industrial or daily things. We can do engineering better thanks to abstraction. - Helps engineers foresee the problems and makes it possible to take precautions in order to solve the problem before it happens. When we abstract something before we work on it, it is easier to get over this problem and cheaper and time-saver because we first use imagination. So the problem can be more solvable and our approach to problem become more fast. They can think correctly of calculations. Abstraction provided the abstract math become the applied math which we use today in modern system. Also, there is a saying \\'\\'Today\\'s abstract math is tomorrow\\' applied math\\'\\'. Besides, algebra is big effect in the engineering. Al Khwarizmi is the father of algebra. We can imagine the problem in our head by abstraction. For example, we can take an easy real-life problem and transfer it to in our head. By that way problem will get easier. This will make think and discuss better. We can do abstract solving.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with open(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/NLP_PROJECT/QAs-3.txt\",'w+') as my_file:\n","  my_file.write(text)"],"metadata":{"id":"VGR5oPgn_wTx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669802733423,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":262,"user":{"displayName":"Mert Bayraktar","userId":"05383922882662101824"}}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"89RNBFoUCyCy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
